DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Piyush Saini (2025372)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 15/20
- Schedule Logic: 22/30
- Journey Planner: 23/25
- Code Quality: 12/15
- Documentation: 7/10
- Bonus: 0/15
TOTAL: 79/100

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (15/20)
✓ Blue Line (named as Blue3 and Blue4)
✓ Magenta Line present
✓ Format: "Station Time Interchange" (non-standard but parseable)
✓ Travel times included
ISSUES:
- Only 87 lines of data (VERY incomplete)
- Missing many stations on both lines
- Unusual naming (Blue3, Blue4 instead of standard Blue Line)
- Data file appears truncated
Deduction: -5 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (22/30)
✓ Works but has timing BUG
Test: Blue3, Rajiv Chowk, 09:18
Output: "Next metro at 09:20, Next Metro's are arriving at 09:21, 09:24, 09:25, 09:28"

ISSUES:
- Shows 09:21 (incorrect - should be 09:24)
- Shows 09:25 (incorrect - should be 09:28)
- Peak hour logic appears broken in nextrain() function
- Frequency calculation has off-by-one errors

The function attempts to calculate arrivals but doesn't properly maintain 4-minute intervals.
Deduction: -8 marks

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (23/25)
✓ WORKS WELL!
Test: Dwarka → Botanical Garden at 08:22
Output: Shows complete journey with ALL station stops:
- Next metro at 08:25
- Lists every intermediate station with arrival times
- Final arrival: 09:34
- Total travel time: 69 minutes

EXCELLENT FEATURE:
+ Shows station-by-station progress (very detailed)
+ Handles same-line journeys correctly
+ Good time calculations
+ interchange1() and interchange2() functions handle complex routing

Minor issue:
- Didn't fully test interchange journeys
Deduction: -2 marks

4. CODE QUALITY (12/15)
Positives:
+ Well-structured modular functions
+ Good function names (data(), routebuilder(), total_time())
+ Clean separation of concerns
+ Good use of helper functions
+ Decent comments

Negatives:
- Some redundant code
- Could be more efficient in some loops
Deduction: -3 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (7/10)
✓ Has README files (PDF format - Readme.pdf and Bonus_Readme.pdf)
ISSUES:
- PDF format not ideal
- Bonus README exists but no bonus features implemented
- Lacks clear execution instructions
Deduction: -3 marks

6. BONUS FEATURES (0/15)
✗ No additional metro lines beyond required
✗ No fare calculation
✗ Bonus README exists but features not implemented

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Journey planner is excellent with detailed station-by-station output
2. Clean, modular code structure
3. Good understanding of graph traversal for route finding
4. interchange1() and interchange2() show sophisticated multi-line routing

ISSUES:
1. Schedule logic has timing bugs (shows incorrect intermediate times)
2. Very incomplete data file (only 87 lines)
3. Bonus features mentioned in README but not implemented

CODE REVIEW:
The nextrain() function has the main bug:
- Calculates metro arrivals but doesn't properly align with 4/8 minute intervals
- The while loop logic needs debugging
- Off-by-one errors in time calculations

RECOMMENDATION:
Strong journey planner implementation shows good programming skills. Schedule logic needs debugging. More complete data collection needed. Overall solid work with some execution issues.
