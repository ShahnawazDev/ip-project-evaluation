Group: 6
Submission File: ip_assignment.py
=================================================

OVERALL RESULT: 65/100 (Regular) + 5/20 (Bonus) = 70 Total
Code Status: RUNS ✓

=================================================
DETAILED BREAKDOWN:
=================================================

1. DATA COLLECTION: 20/20
   ✓ Metro data includes Blue and Magenta lines
   ✓ Station data is complete and accurate
   ✓ Data format is properly structured with both directions
   ✓ Covers required Blue and Magenta lines as per assignment

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC: 30/30
   ✓ Correct peak hour identification (8:00-10:00 AM, 5:00-7:00 PM)
   ✓ Proper frequency: 4 minutes during peak, 8 minutes off-peak
   ✓ Service hours correctly implemented (6:00 AM - 11:00 PM)
   ✓ Next train calculation logic is accurate
   ✓ Shows multiple upcoming trains correctly

3. JOURNEY PLANNER: 10/25
   ✗ CRITICAL BUG: Same-line journeys incorrectly trigger interchange logic
     - Test case: Dwarka Sector-8 to Dwarka Sector-14 (both on Blue Line)
     - Expected: Direct journey
     - Actual: Shows interchange on the same line at departure station
     - This is a fundamental logic error affecting core functionality
   
   ✗ Code logic error in journeyPlan function (lines 159-165):
     - The check for srcLine == dstLine is not followed by proper return
     - The check for same station (line 163) comes AFTER fare calculation
     - Lines 168-174 are unreachable code due to incorrect indentation
     - This causes all same-line journeys to incorrectly use interchange logic
   
   ✓ Interchange journeys work correctly (tested Blue to Magenta via Janakpuri West)
   ✓ Time calculations are accurate for interchange scenarios
   ✓ Handles station name normalization (case-insensitive, hyphen handling)
   
   DEDUCTIONS:
   - Same-line journey bug: -10 marks
   - Unreachable code/logic error: -5 marks

4. CODE QUALITY: 10/15
   ✓ Generally readable code with meaningful function names
   ✓ Good modularization (separate functions for different tasks)
   ✓ Case-insensitive station name handling
   ✓ Basic input validation for time format
   
   ✗ Critical logic error in control flow (if-statements without proper returns)
   ✗ Unreachable code indicates poor testing
   ✗ No error handling for edge cases (e.g., station not on specified line)
   ✗ Hardcoded values (should be constants with better names)
   ✗ Missing comments for complex logic
   
   DEDUCTIONS:
   - Logic errors and unreachable code: -3 marks
   - Insufficient error handling: -2 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION: 8/10
   ✓ README file provided (readme.txt)
   ✓ Bonus README provided (readme_bonus.txt)
   ✓ Explains assumptions clearly
   ✓ Mentions group members
   ✓ Basic usage instructions for input format
   ✓ Only one Python file, so no ambiguity about which to run
   
   ✗ Missing explicit execution command (e.g., "Run: python ip_assignment.py")
   ✗ No clear explanation of program flow or what user will see
   
   DEDUCTIONS:
   - Missing execution command: -2 marks

6. ENHANCEMENTS (BONUS): 5/20
   ✓ Fare calculator implemented (10 + 30 per interchange structure)
   ✓ Fare shows in journey output
   ✓ Basic fare logic works
   
   ✗ Only 2 lines (Blue & Magenta) - minimum requirement, no extra lines
   ✗ No additional features beyond basic fare
   ✗ Fare calculation is very simplistic (doesn't account for actual distance)
   
   BONUS AWARDED:
   - Fare calculator (basic implementation): 5 marks

=================================================
CRITICAL ISSUES SUMMARY:
=================================================
1. Same-line journeys show incorrect interchange behavior - this is a MAJOR bug
   that makes the journey planner unreliable for the most basic use case

2. Unreachable code in lines 168-174 indicates the code was not properly tested
   for same-line journeys

3. The logic flow in journeyPlan function needs restructuring - the if statement
   for srcLine == dstLine should return immediately after calculating same-line
   journey, but instead the code falls through to interchange logic

=================================================
POSITIVE ASPECTS:
=================================================
1. Code runs without errors (critical requirement met)
2. Schedule logic is excellent and handles all requirements
3. Data collection is complete and accurate
4. Interchange journeys work correctly
5. Good documentation with clear README files
6. Attempted bonus feature (fare calculator)

=================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
=================================================
1. Fix the same-line journey logic by properly returning after calculating
   direct routes (add return statement after line 162)
2. Move the same-station check before the fare calculation
3. Add comprehensive test cases covering all journey types
4. Implement proper error handling for invalid inputs
5. Add more metro lines for higher bonus marks
6. Improve fare calculation to be distance-based

=================================================
