DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Prashun Jha (2025390)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 17/20
- Schedule Logic: 0/30
- Journey Planner: 22/25
- Code Quality: 10/15
- Documentation: 10/10
- Bonus: 0/15
TOTAL: 59/100

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (17/20)
✓ Blue-3 Line (main Blue Line)
✓ Blue-4 Line (Vaishali branch)
✓ Magenta Line complete
✓ 81 stations total with good coverage
✓ CSV format with proper headers
✓ Travel times realistic (1-5 minutes)
✓ Interchange points marked
ISSUES:
- Slightly incomplete coverage of full network
- Screenshot included but not needed
Deduction: -3 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (0/30)
✗ NOT IMPLEMENTED
The code only implements journey planning, not a separate schedule timing module.
User cannot check "when is next metro at station X" independently.
All timing calculations are embedded within journey planner only.

Required functionality missing:
- No standalone schedule timing query
- No "next metro at station" feature
- No subsequent metro times display

This is a CRITICAL OMISSION of core requirement.

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (22/25)
✓ WORKS WELL!

Test 1 - Same Line: Dwarka Sector - 21 → Botanical Garden at 08:22
Output:
- Journey Plan shown
- Next metro at 08:24
- Arrive at Botanical Garden at 09:43
- Total travel time: 81 minutes
✓ Correct calculation

Test 2 - Interchange: Dwarka Sector - 21 → Hauz Khas
Output:
- Shows transfer at Botanical Garden
- Adds 10 minutes for walking/interchange
- Next Magenta metro departs at 09:56
- Final arrival at Hauz Khas at 10:30
✓ Handles interchange correctly

EXCELLENT FEATURES:
+ BFS-style pathfinding algorithm
+ Handles forward/backward traversal on lines
+ Proper interchange detection
+ 10-minute interchange delay included

Minor issues:
- Uses 12-hour time format requiring AM/PM input (non-standard)
Deduction: -3 marks

4. CODE QUALITY (10/15)
Positives:
+ Good modular function design
+ BFS pathfinding is well-implemented
+ check_gap() function handles peak hours correctly
+ add_minutes() helper function is clean
+ Good variable names

Negatives:
- HARDCODED ABSOLUTE PATH: "/Users/prashunjha/Downloads/delhi_metro/metro_data.txt"
  This prevents code from running on any other system!
- No menu system (expects all inputs upfront)
- Some redundant nested loops
- Could use more comments
Deduction: -5 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (10/10)
✓ Good README.md file provided
✓ Explains approach and design decisions
✓ Mentions DMRC website as data source
✓ Discusses why list-of-lists was chosen over dictionary
✓ Clear feature description
✓ Provides context on how the program works

Per evaluation guidelines: "If a README file is provided → Full 10 marks for documentation"

MINOR ISSUES (not penalized per guidelines):
- Could include more explicit step-by-step execution instructions
- No mention of hardcoded path issue (though evaluator fixed it)

6. BONUS FEATURES (0/15)
✗ No additional metro lines
✗ No fare calculation
✗ No extra features

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Journey planner is sophisticated with BFS algorithm
2. Handles interchange intelligently
3. Good code structure and modularization
4. Thoughtful README explaining design choices

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. NO SCHEDULE LOGIC MODULE - Missing entire Phase 2 Part A
2. Hardcoded Mac-specific absolute path makes code non-portable
3. No menu system - all inputs must be provided upfront

CODE REVIEW:
The metro_simulator() function implements an excellent pathfinding algorithm:
- Uses BFS-style exploration with visited tracking
- Properly detects line changes
- Calculates waiting times with peak hour awareness
- Adds realistic 10-minute interchange delay

However, the missing schedule timing module is a critical omission.

RECOMMENDATION:
Student shows strong understanding of graph algorithms and route planning. However, failed to implement the schedule timing module (Phase 2 Part A) which is a required core feature. Also needs to fix hardcoded path and add proper menu interface.
