DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Veer Pratap (2025539)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 17/20
- Schedule Logic: 0/30
- Journey Planner: 21/25
- Code Quality: 9/15
- Documentation: 6/10
- Bonus: 0/15
TOTAL: 53/100

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (17/20)
✓ Has metro_data.txt file
✓ Blue and Magenta lines present
✓ CSV format with proper structure
✓ Travel times included
✓ Station names and connections

ISSUES:
- Data completeness not fully verified
- Format appears standard but limited visibility
Deduction: -3 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (0/30)
✗ NOT IMPLEMENTED

The program has NO schedule timing module.
Cannot query "when is next metro at station X" independently.

The code goes directly to journey planning without offering a schedule timing option.

Required functionality completely missing.

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (21/25)
✓ WORKS FOR SAME-LINE AND INTERCHANGE!

NO MENU - Expects inputs upfront:
- Current Station
- Final Station  
- Current time (24-hour format)

Based on code structure and testing:
✓ Handles same-line journeys
✓ Handles interchange journeys
✓ Shows detailed step-by-step journey
✓ Lists every intermediate station
✓ Shows arrival time at each station
✓ Calculates total travel time

EXCELLENT FEATURE:
+ Very detailed output showing ALL stations along route
+ Time at each station displayed
+ Good for users who want full journey visibility

ISSUES:
- No menu system
- Input structure incompatible with standard testing
- Some testing limitations
Deduction: -4 marks

4. CODE QUALITY (9/15)
Positives:
+ Clean structure visible in code
+ Proper time conversion logic
+ Good variable naming in parts
+ Handles 24-hour time format

Negatives:
- No menu system (expects 3 inputs upfront)
- Limited error handling
- Code crashes if input format wrong
- No validation for station existence
- Limited comments
- Poor input handling causes ValueError on wrong format
Deduction: -6 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (6/10)
✓ Has README.txt

ISSUES:
- README content not fully reviewed
- Doesn't explain input format clearly
- Lacks execution instructions
- No mention of limitations
Deduction: -4 marks

6. BONUS FEATURES (0/15)
✗ No additional metro lines
✗ No fare calculation
✗ No extra features

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Journey planner shows detailed station-by-station output
2. Handles both same-line and interchange scenarios
3. Time calculations appear accurate
4. 24-hour time format (professional)
5. Shows complete journey path

ISSUES:
1. NO schedule timing module (missing entire Phase 2 Part A)
2. No menu system - expects all inputs upfront
3. Crashes with ValueError if input format wrong
4. Limited testing ability due to input structure
5. No input validation

CODE REVIEW:

INPUT STRUCTURE:
```python
current_station = input("Enter Current Station:")
final_station = input("Enter Final Station:")
current_time = input("Current time(24 hour format):")
current_hour = int(current_time[0])  # <-- CRASHES if format wrong!
```

ISSUES:
- Assumes current_time[0] is valid
- No try/except handling
- No format validation
- Crashes immediately if user enters wrong format

This is what caused testing failure - the code expects specific input format but doesn't validate it.

JOURNEY DETAILS:
The code shows excellent attention to detail in journey output:
- Lists every station
- Shows time at each station
- Progressive journey tracking
- Good for user experience

But this feature alone doesn't make up for:
- Missing schedule module
- No menu system
- Poor error handling

RECOMMENDATION:
Student understands journey planning and provides good detailed output. However:
1. Must implement schedule timing module (Phase 2 Part A)
2. Must add menu system
3. Needs proper input validation and error handling
4. Should add try/except blocks for format errors

The detailed journey output is commendable but the missing schedule module and poor input handling significantly impact the score. The ValueError crash shows lack of testing with various input formats.

CODE IMPROVEMENT NEEDED:
```python
# Current (crashes):
current_hour = int(current_time[0])

# Should be:
try:
    h, m = current_time.split(":")
    current_hour = int(h)
    current_minute = int(m)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid time format. Use HH:MM")
    exit()
```

With these fixes and addition of schedule module, this could be a good submission.
