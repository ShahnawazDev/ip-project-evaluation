DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Sadaanant (sadaanant25444@iiitd.ac.in)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 17/20
- Schedule Logic: 0/30
- Journey Planner: 23/25
- Code Quality: 11/15
- Documentation: 7/10
- Bonus: 5/15
TOTAL: 63/105

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (17/20)
✓ UNUSUAL APPROACH: Data written to file at runtime!
✓ Blue Line: Complete with Vaishali branch (56 stations in code)
✓ Magenta Line: Complete (25 stations in code)
✓ Hardcoded in Python lists: blue_line_data[] and magenta[]
✓ Format: "Line, Station, NextStation, TravelTime, Interchange, Fare"
✓ Includes fare data in source

ISSUES:
- Data is in Python code, not a separate text file initially
- Written to metro_data.txt at runtime (lines 1-89)
- This is unusual and not best practice
- Creates/overwrites file each run
Deduction: -3 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (0/30)
✗ NOT IMPLEMENTED AS SEPARATE MODULE
No standalone schedule timing feature.
Program only does journey planning, not individual station timing queries.

User cannot check "when is next metro at station X" without specifying a destination.

Required functionality completely missing.

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (23/25)
✓ WORKS WELL!

Test: Dwarka → Botanical Garden at 08:22
Output:
- Next metro at 8 : 24
- Journey Plan:
- Start at Dwarka ( Blue Line )
- Arrive at Janakpuri West at 8 : 32
- Transfer to Magenta Line
- Next Magenta metro departs at 8 : 36
- Arrive at Botanical Garden at 9 : 43
- Total travel time: 81 minutes
- Total Fare: 990

✓ Shows complete journey plan
✓ Handles line changes correctly
✓ Calculates interchange timing
✓ Shows transfer station

ISSUES:
- FARE CALCULATION COMPLETELY WRONG: Shows Rs. 990 for a journey that should cost Rs. 40-50!
- The fare_calculator() function adds up all individual fares incorrectly
- Appears to be summing fare column values (all 11s) multiple times

Minor issue:
- Spacing in time display (8 : 24 instead of 8:24)

Deduction: -2 marks (would be more but fare is bonus)

4. CODE QUALITY (11/15)
Positives:
+ Uses datetime module properly
+ Imports and time handling are correct
+ Creates reverse_data for bidirectional travel (smart approach)
+ Function modularization (fare_calculator defined)
+ Good variable names

Negatives:
- Writing data to file at runtime is poor practice
- No menu system (expects source, dest, time upfront)
- Fare calculation logic is fundamentally broken
- Limited error handling
Deduction: -4 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (7/10)
✓ Has READMEFILE.pdf

ISSUES:
- PDF format not ideal (text preferred)
- Couldn't fully review PDF content
- Doesn't explain unusual data file creation approach
- Lacks clear execution instructions
Deduction: -3 marks

6. BONUS FEATURES (5/15)
✓ FARE CALCULATION ATTEMPTED (5 marks)
  BUT COMPLETELY WRONG IMPLEMENTATION
  - fare_calculator() function exists
  - Shows fare in output
  - But calculation is incorrect (990 instead of ~40)
  - Appears to sum all fare values in path, not calculate properly

✗ No additional metro lines
✗ No other bonus features

Partial credit: 5/15 for attempt

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Journey planner works for routing
2. Handles line changes correctly
3. Creates bidirectional data (reverse_data) cleverly
4. Shows transfer stations and timing
5. Uses datetime module appropriately

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. No schedule logic module (missing entire Phase 2 Part A)
2. Fare calculation is completely wrong (990 rupees!)
3. Data stored in Python code and written at runtime (poor design)
4. No menu interface

CODE REVIEW:

UNUSUAL DESIGN CHOICE:
Lines 1-89 write data to metro_data.txt every time program runs:
```python
f=open("metro_data.txt","w")
f.writelines(blue_line_data)
f.writelines(magenta)
f.close()
```
This is inefficient and unconventional. Data should be in a separate file.

FARE CALCULATION BUG:
```python
def fare_calculator(source,destination):
    fare= 0
    found= False
    for i in working_data:
        if(i[1]==source and i[0]==line1):
            found = True
        if(found==True and i[0]==line1):
            fare += i[5]  # <-- Adds 11 for every station!
        if(i[2]==destination and found and i[0]==line1):
            break
    return fare
```
The function adds the fare value (11) for every station between source and destination. This is wrong. It should calculate based on:
- Number of stations traveled
- DMRC fare slabs

Result: Shows 990 rupees for a normal journey!

RECOMMENDATION:
Student has decent understanding of journey planning but:
1. Failed to implement schedule timing module
2. Fare calculation is fundamentally broken
3. Unusual data management approach needs improvement
4. Needs menu system and better testing

The working journey planner saves the score from being very low.
