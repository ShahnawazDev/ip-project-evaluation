========================================
DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT (REEVALUATED)
Student: Sadaanant (sadaanant25444@iiitd.ac.in)
Date: December 13, 2025
Reevaluation Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 17/20
- Schedule Logic: 20/30
- Journey Planner: 23/25
- Code Quality: 12/15
- Documentation: 10/10
- Bonus: 5/20
TOTAL (Regular): 82/100
TOTAL (With Bonus): 87/120

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (17/20)
✓ UNUSUAL APPROACH: Data written to file at runtime!
✓ Blue Line: Complete with Vaishali branch (56 stations in code)
✓ Magenta Line: Complete (25 stations in code)
✓ Hardcoded in Python lists: blue_line_data[] and magenta[]
✓ Format: "Line, Station, NextStation, TravelTime, Interchange, Fare"
✓ Includes fare data in source

ISSUES:
- Data is in Python code, not a separate text file initially
- Written to metro_data.txt at runtime (lines 1-89)
- This is unusual and not best practice
- Creates/overwrites file each run
Deduction: -3 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (20/30)
✓ SCHEDULE LOGIC EXISTS AND WORKS!

REEVALUATION FINDINGS:
- metro_timing() function exists at lines 155-169
- Correctly calculates next metro time with peak/off-peak handling
- Peak hours (8-10 AM, 5-7 PM): 4 min frequency
- Off-peak: 8 min frequency
- Prints "Next metro at X:Y" (line 168)
- TESTED: Shows correct times (e.g., 9:18 → 9:20, 8:22 → 8:24, 7:15 → 7:20)

ISSUE:
✗ NOT A STANDALONE MODULE
- No menu system to just check metro timings
- Always runs embedded with journey planner (line 169)
- User cannot check "next metro at station X" without specifying destination
- Assignment requires TWO SEPARATE functionalities, got one combined

VERDICT: Has logic + displays output, but not separate module
Award: 20/30 (previous 0/30 was too harsh)

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (23/25)
✓ WORKS WELL!

Test: Dwarka → Botanical Garden at 08:22
Output:
- Next metro at 8 : 24
- Journey Plan:
- Start at Dwarka ( Blue Line )
- Arrive at Janakpuri West at 8 : 32
- Transfer to Magenta Line
- Next Magenta metro departs at 8 : 36
- Arrive at Botanical Garden at 9 : 43
- Total travel time: 81 minutes
- Total Fare: 990

✓ Shows complete journey plan
✓ Handles line changes correctly
✓ Calculates interchange timing
✓ Shows transfer station

ISSUES:
- FARE CALCULATION COMPLETELY WRONG: Shows Rs. 990 for a journey that should cost Rs. 40-50!
- The fare_calculator() function adds up all individual fares incorrectly
- Appears to be summing fare column values (all 11s) multiple times

Minor issue:
- Spacing in time display (8 : 24 instead of 8:24)

Deduction: -2 marks (would be more but fare is bonus)

4. CODE QUALITY (12/15)
Positives:
+ Uses datetime module properly
+ Imports and time handling are correct
+ Creates reverse_data for bidirectional travel (SMART approach - lines 132-135)
+ Function modularization (metro_timing, metro_timing_interchange, fare_calculator, time_calculator1)
+ Good variable names and logical structure
+ Handles both directions for pathfinding
+ Proper assert for time validation (lines 117-121)

Negatives:
- Writing data to file at runtime is poor practice (lines 1-89)
- No menu system (expects source, dest, time upfront)
- Fare calculation logic is fundamentally broken (adds all fares)
- Limited error handling beyond time validation
Deduction: -3 mark10/10)
✓ Has READMEFILE.pdf (112KB, dated 12-12-2025)

REEVALUATION:
Per checking instructions: "If a README file is provided → Full 10 marks for documentation"
- README file exists ✓
- Proper file size indicates substantive content ✓
- Following evaluation guidelines strictly ✓

FULL MARKS: 10/10 (no deduction)nusual data file creation approach
- Lacks clear execution instructions
Deduction: -3 marks
20)
✓ FARE CALCULATION ATTEMPTED (5 marks)
  BUT COMPLETELY WRONG IMPLEMENTATION
  - fare_calculator() function exists (lines 140-150)
  - Shows fare in output
  - But calculation is incorrect:
    * Dwarka → Botanical Garden: Shows 990 (should be ~40-50)
    * Dwarka → Rajouri Garden: Shows 110 (should be ~30-40)
    * Dwarka Sector 21 → Noida Electronic City: Shows 539 (should be ~50-60)
  - Root cause: Sums all fare column values (11) for every station
  - Should use distance-based or station-count-based calculation

✗ No additional metro lines
✗ No other bonus features

Partial credit: 5/20 for attempt (total bonus marks is 20, not 15)
Partial credit: 5/15 for attempt
Schedule logic EXISTS and works correctly with peak/off-peak timing
2. Journey planner works excellently for both same-line and interchange
3. Creates bidirectional data (reverse_data) cleverly for pathfinding
4. Handles line changes correctly with proper interchange logic
5. Shows transfer stations and timing accurately
6. Uses datetime module appropriately
7. Good function modularization

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. No menu interface - schedule logic not separate module (embedded only)
2. Fare calculation is completely wrong (990 rupees for normal journey!)
3. Data stored in Python code and written at runtime (unconventional design)
4. No standalone option to just check metro timings
CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. No schedule logic module (missing entire Phase 2 Part A)
2. Fare calculation is completely wrong (990 rupees!)
3. Data stored in Python code and written at runtime (poor design)
4. No menu interface

CODE REVIEW:

UNUSUAL DESIGN CHOICE:
Lines 1-89 write data to metro_data.txt every time program runs:
```python
f=open("metro_data.txt","w")
f.writelines(blue_line_data)
f.writelines(magenta)
f.close()
```
This is inefficient and unconventional. Data should be in a separate file.

FARE CALCULATION BUG:
```python
def fare_calculator(source,destination):
    fare= 0
    found= False
    for i in working_data:
        if(i[1]==source and i[0]==line1):
            found = True
        if(found==True and i[0]==line1):
            fare += i[5]  # <-- Adds 11 for every station!
        if(i[2]==destination and found and i[0]==line1):
            break
    return fare
```
ThEVALUATION SUMMARY:
After thorough testing, this submission is significantly better than initially evaluated:

CORRECTED FINDINGS:
1. Schedule logic DOES EXIST and works correctly (was marked 0, now 20/30)
2. Documentation should get full marks per guidelines (was 7, now 10/10)
3. Code quality slightly better than assessed (was 11, now 12/15)

SCORE CHANGE: 58/100 → 82/100 (Regular)
WITH BONUS: 63/120 → 87/120

RECOMMENDATION:
Student demonstrates solid understanding of:
- Metro scheduling with peak/off-peak logic
- Journey planning with interchange handling
- Bidirectional pathfinding algorithms
- Time calculations and datetime manipulation

Areas for improvement:
- Implement proper menu system for separate modules
- Fix fare calculation algorithm completely
- Use proper data file management (don't write at runtime)
- Better error handling and testing

Overall: Good working implementation with one structural flaw (no menu)
1. Failed to implement schedule timing module
2. Fare calculation is fundamentally broken
3. Unusual data management approach needs improvement
4. Needs menu system and better testing

The working journey planner saves the score from being very low.
