Assumptions:
*We have been given the assumptions that the metro opearates from 6:00am to 11:00 pm and 
has a frequency of a metro passing in 4 mins during peak hours and 8 mins during 
non peak hours (the peak and non peak hours have been mentioned in the assignmnt handout).
*The trains travel on a ideal time plan with no delays or change in schedule.
*2 interchange stations exist Janakpuri West/ Janak Puri West and Botanical Garden.
*The metro runs bi-directional(Both ways).
*The program assumes the user wants earliest possible arrival/departure.

*(As an Extra) The program assumes that in a case of a interchange 
  an extra 5 mins have been added as time to switch platforms.
