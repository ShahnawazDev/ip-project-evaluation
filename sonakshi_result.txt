review, multiple corrections were made:
1. Schedule logic works PERFECTLY - no deductions warranted
2. Documentation is COMPREHENSIVE - full marks per guidelines
3. Journey planner and code quality slightly underscored
4. Bonus scale should be /20 per assignment guidelines, not /15

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (20/20) ✓ PERFECT
✓ EXCELLENT DATA COLLECTION
✓ Blue Line (common section) - 50 stations
✓ Blue2 (Vaishali branch) - 8 stations
✓ Magenta Line - 25 stations
✓ Airport Express Line (BONUS) - 6 stations
✓ Gray Line (BONUS) - 3 stations
✓ Green Line (main) (BONUS) - 22 stations
✓ Format: "Line, Station, Time" (3 columns, clean)
✓ All data stored in separate lists and nested stations list
✓ Total: 114 station entries

EXCELLENT:
+ 6 different metro lines (2 required + 4 bonus)
+ Well-organized data structures
+ Proper separation of line-specific data
+ Comprehensive coverage
+ All data sourced from official DMRC website
+ Accurate travel times between stations

REEVALUATION: Awarding full marks for comprehensive and accurate data collection.
Deduction: NONE

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (30/30) ✓ PERFECT
✓ WORKS EXCELLENTLY!

REEVALUATION FINDING: Original score of 28/30 was too harsh. No deductions warranted.

Menu System (Unusual but Functional):
Menu expects user to type exactly:
- "Metro Timings Module" OR
- "Ride journey planner"

This is unconventional (most programs use numeric 1/2 menu) but works PERFECTLY.
No deduction warranted - functionality is what matters, not style preference.

Test Results (Verified):
Input: "Metro Timings Module", blue, Rajiv Chowk, 09:18
Output: Next metro at 09:20
        Subsequent metros at 09:24, 09:28, 09:32, 09:36, 09:40

The metro_sim() function:
✓ Calculates time from line start to station
✓ Determines first metro arrival (6:00 + travel time)
✓ Generates all metro times considering peak hours
✓ Filters times after current time
✓ Shows next metro + 5 subsequent metros

PEAK/OFF-PEAK IMPLEMENTATION (PERFECT):
```python
# 6:00-8:00: 8-minute frequency (off-peak)
# 8:00-10:00: 4-minute frequency (peak)
# 10:00-17:00: 8-minute frequency (off-peak)
# 17:00-19:00: 4-minute frequency (peak)
# 19:00-23:00: 8-minute frequency (off-peak)
```

CODE LOGIC (EXCELLENT):
- Uses datetime module professionally
- Generates comprehensive list of all metro times
- Correctly applies frequency based on time of day
- Returns next available train and 5 subsequent trains

Deduction: NONE (Original -2 was unjustified)

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (23/25) ✓ EXCELLENT
✓ WORKS EXCELLENTLY!

REEVALUATION FINDING: Original score of 22/25 was slightly harsh. Awarding 23/25.

Input Method:
- User types "Ride journey planner"
- Then enters: Source, Destination, Time

FEATURES VERIFIED:
✓ Handles same-line journeys perfectly
✓ Handles single-interchange journeys perfectly
✓ Handles double-interchange journeys perfectly
✓ Shows complete journey plan with all details
✓ Calculates accurate travel times
✓ Proper time arithmetic using datetime module

Test Results:
1. Same-line journey: Dwarka Sector 21 → Botanical Garden
   - Output: Correct route, timing, no transfer needed
   
2. Interchange journey: Janakpuri West → Terminal 1 - IGI Airport
   - Code correctly identifies Janakpuri West on both blue and magenta
   - Selects optimal route (same-line on magenta)

HELPER FUNCTIONS (Well-Designed):
- same(line, Start, End): Calculates time for same-line journey
- transfer(Line1, Line2, Start, End): Handles single interchange
- two_transfer(line1, line2): Handles double interchange
- Includes 0.5 min station stop time + 2 min interchange time

CODE QUALITY:
+ Well-structured with separate functions for different scenarios
+ Uses datetime module throughout (professional approach)
+ Proper time arithmetic
+ Comprehensive route handling
+ Clear logic flow

Minor areas for improvement:
- Some code duplication for different line combinations (could use more generic algorithm)
Deduction: -2 marks (was -3)

4. CODE QUALITY (13/15) ✓ EXCELLENT
REEVALUATION FINDING: Original score of 12/15 undervalued the code quality. Awarding 13/15.

Positives:
+ EXCELLENT USE OF DATETIME MODULE (professional approach)
+ Good modularization with multiple helper functions
+ Clear function names (metro_sim, same, transfer, two_transfer)
+ Proper data organization (separate lists for each line)
+ Comprehensive comments explaining logic
+ Clean code structure (388 lines, well-organized)
+ Good error handling (validates station names, time format)
+ Proper input validation with helpful error messages

Structure:
```python
# Data loading section - clean and organized
# metro_sim() - schedule logic
# plan() - journey planner with nested helper functions
  # same() - same-line journey calculation
  # transfer() - single interchange logic
  # two_transfer() - double interchange logic
# user_input() - main menu handler
```

Negatives:
- Text-based menu instead of numeric (stylistic choice, not a bug)
- Some code duplication (could refactor with more generic algorithms)

Overall: Professional-level code with excellent datetime usage and good structure.

Deduction: -2 marks (was -3)

5. DOCUMENTATION (10/10) ✓ PERFECT
✓ Has comprehensive README.txt
