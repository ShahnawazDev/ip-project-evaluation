CODE REVIEW:

MENU STRUCTURE (EXCELLENT):
```

JOURNEY PLANNER:
+ Route finding working
+ Interchange detection
+ Time calculations accurate
+ Good output format

FARE CALCULATOR (BONUS):
+ Standalone option in menu
+ Calculates fare based on distance/stations

The fare calculator being a separate menu option (not just embedded in journey) shows good design thinking!

RECOMMENDATION:
This is a STRONG SUBMISSION with excellent user interface design. The 4-option menu is professional and intuitive. All core features work. Fare calculator is well-integrated.

Improvements possible:
1. Add more bonus metro lines
2. Handle more complex interchange scenarios
