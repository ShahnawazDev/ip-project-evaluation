SCHEDULE LOGIC VERIFICATION FOR PRASHUN JHA
============================================

ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENT (Phase 2 Part A):
-----------------------------------------
"Metro Timings Module" - A separate feature where user can check:
  Input: Line = Blue, Station = Rajiv Chowk, Current time = 09:18
  Output: Next metro at 09:20, Subsequent metros at 09:24, 09:28, ...

This should work WITHOUT planning a journey (no destination needed).

PRASHUN'S CODE STRUCTURE:
--------------------------
1. Input Requirements (lines 12-15):
   - start_station = input("Enter current station: ")
   - end_station = input("Enter station where you want to go: ")  ← REQUIRES DESTINATION
   - time1 = input("enter current_time1: ")
   - ampm = input("enter am or pm: ")

2. Functions Present:
   - check_gap(h, ampm) - Calculates frequency (4 min peak, 8 min off-peak)
   - add_minutes(h, m, val) - Adds time correctly
   - metro_simulator(start, end, time, ampm) - Journey planner with embedded schedule logic

3. Menu System: NONE
   - No options to choose between "Check schedule" vs "Plan journey"
   - Program goes directly to journey planning

TEST RESULTS:
-------------
Test 1: Can we check schedule by entering same station for both start and end?
   Input: Rajiv Chowk -> Rajiv Chowk at 09:18 am
   Result: IndexError at line 162 (path[1] doesn't exist)
   Conclusion: Code CRASHES when trying to use for schedule checking

Test 2: Can we skip destination input?
   Result: NO - destination is mandatory input at line 13
   
Test 3: Is there a separate schedule checking function?
   Result: NO - only metro_simulator() which requires both start AND end

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
------------------
✓ The underlying logic EXISTS:
  - check_gap() correctly calculates 4/8 minute frequency
  - add_minutes() works properly
  - Peak hour detection works (8-10 AM, 5-7 PM)

✗ But it's NOT accessible as a separate module:
  - User CANNOT check schedule without entering destination
  - No menu to choose schedule-only mode
  - Schedule logic is embedded INSIDE journey planner only
  - Cannot be used independently

COMPARISON TO ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENT:
--------------------------------------
Assignment says: "Metro Timings Module" (Part A) and "Ride journey planner" (Part B)
These should be TWO SEPARATE functionalities.

Prashun implemented: ONE functionality (journey planner) with schedule logic embedded.

VERDICT:
--------
The evaluation of 0/30 for Schedule Logic is CORRECT.

While the underlying schedule calculation logic is implemented correctly,
it is NOT available as a separate, standalone module as required by the
assignment. Users cannot check "next metro at station X" without planning
a full journey.

This is a fundamental architectural issue - the assignment requires TWO
separate modules, but only ONE (journey planner) was implemented.
