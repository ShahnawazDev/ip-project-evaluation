========================================
DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Satwik Singh (2025461)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 18/20
- Schedule Logic: 25/30
- Journey Planner: 0/25
- Code Quality: 12/15
- Documentation: 10/10
- Bonus: 10/15
TOTAL: 75/115

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (18/20)
✓ GOOD COMPREHENSIVE DATA
✓ Blue Line (Vaishali and Noida branches)
✓ Magenta Line
✓ Red Line (BONUS)
✓ Orange Line (BONUS)
✓ CSV format with proper headers
✓ Travel times included
✓ Interchange points marked

ISSUES:
- Initial hardcoded path: "C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\college\metro_data.txt"
  (Fixed for testing)
- Some data parsing complexity
Deduction: -2 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (25/30)
✓ WORKS WITH MENU!

Test: Option 1, Station: Rajiv Chowk, Time: 09:18
Output shows:
```
Next Train is at Rajiv Chowk
Current Time: 09:18

Blue Line (Vaishali Branch):
  1. 09:21 - Towards Vaishali
  2. 09:22 - Towards Dwarka Sector 21
  3. 09:25 - Towards Vaishali
  4. 09:26 - Towards Dwarka Sector 21
  5. 09:29 - Towards Vaishali
```

✓ EXCELLENT FEATURE: Shows trains in BOTH DIRECTIONS!
✓ Shows 5 upcoming trains
✓ Indicates which direction each train is going
✓ User-friendly output

ISSUES:
- Some time calculations appear slightly off
- Doesn't distinguish between lines clearly when station is on multiple lines
Deduction: -5 marks

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (0/25)
✗ CRASHES WITH IndexError

Test: Dwarka → Botanical Garden
Error: IndexError: list index out of range (line 179)

The planJourney() function calls:
- singleLine() → nextstattrain() → crashes accessing terminals[1]

CODE ISSUE:
```python
def nextstattrain(keyofline, src, dest, starttime):
    ...
    terminal = terminals[1]  # <-- CRASHES HERE
```

The terminals list doesn't have index 1 in some cases.

Journey planner has sophisticated multi-interchange logic (twointer() function) but crashes on basic same-line journey!

This is a CRITICAL BUG that makes the feature non-functional.

4. CODE QUALITY (12/15)
Positives:
+ 4-OPTION MENU SYSTEM (excellent!)
+ Good code structure with many helper functions
+ convert() for time conversion
+ Sophisticated routing logic attempted
+ Good variable naming
+ Uses proper data structures (dictionaries, sets)
+ BlueVaishali and BlueNoida separation is smart

Negatives:
- Hardcoded path initially
- Complex nested logic difficult to debug
- IndexError shows insufficient testing
Deduction: -3 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (10/10)
✓ EXCELLENT DOCUMENTATION
✓ Has video demo (DMRC program run.mp4)
✓ Two PDF READMEs:
  - ReadMe (Main Assignment).pdf
  - ReadMe (Bonus Component).pdf
✓ Video shows program in action
✓ Comprehensive documentation approach

PERFECT SCORE for documentation effort

6. BONUS FEATURES (10/15)
✓ RED LINE: Implemented (5 marks)
✓ ORANGE LINE: Implemented (5 marks)
✓ FARE CALCULATOR: Menu option 3 exists (but crashed during test)

Would be full marks but:
- Fare calculator couldn't be fully tested due to crashes
- Journey planner crashes affect overall bonus functionality

Deduction: -5 marks

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. EXCELLENT MENU SYSTEM with 4 options
2. Schedule logic shows trains in both directions (unique feature!)
3. Comprehensive data with bonus lines
4. Video documentation is creative and helpful
5. Sophisticated code structure with proper data modeling
6. Good understanding of complex routing scenarios

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Journey planner crashes with IndexError (line 179)
2. Hardcoded absolute path (though fixable)
3. Insufficient testing - basic same-line journey fails

CODE REVIEW:

MENU SYSTEM (EXCELLENT):
```
Delhi Metro Menu
(1) Check the next metro
(2) Plan your journey  
(3) Calculate fare for your travel
(4) Exit
```
This is exactly what's expected!

SCHEDULE LOGIC (VERY GOOD):
The bidirectional display is a great feature:
- Shows trains going to Vaishali
- Shows trains going to Dwarka Sector 21
- User can see all options

JOURNEY PLANNER (BROKEN):
The code attempts to handle:
- Same line (singleLine function)
- One interchange (oneinter function)
- Two interchanges (twointer function)

But crashes on basic same-line journey due to array index bug.

Bug location:
```python
def nextstattrain(keyofline, src, dest, starttime):
    ...
    terminals = termm.get(keyofline, [])
    ...
    terminal = terminals[1]  # <-- Assumes 2 terminals, but some lines have 1
```

RECOMMENDATION:
Student shows excellent understanding of UI/UX (menu system, bidirectional display) and has attempted sophisticated multi-interchange routing. However, the IndexError bug is critical and shows lack of testing. With bug fixes, this could be a top-tier submission. The documentation with video is commendable. Needs better error handling and testing.
