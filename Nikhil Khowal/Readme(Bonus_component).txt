Expanded Network (Additional Lines): * In addition to the required Blue and Magenta lines, the system now supports the Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli to Millennium City Centre) and the Violet Line (Kashmere Gate to Raja Nahar Singh).
There is also a common mistake observed when I tested the code with my parents. They wrote violet as purple. Thus, there is a built-in feature to convert purple to violet.
