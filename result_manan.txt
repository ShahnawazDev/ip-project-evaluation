✓ CSV format with proper header and consistent structure
✓ Data sourced from official DMRC website (documented in README)

Strengths:
- Very comprehensive Blue Line data including all branches
- Clean, well-structured CSV format
- Proper identification of interchange stations

SCORE: 20/20
Assessment: Excellent data collection, comprehensive and accurate


2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (30 marks)
----------------------------
✓ Service hours correctly implemented (06:00 AM - 11:00 PM)
✓ Peak hours logic working (8-10 AM, 5-7 PM → 4 min frequency)
✓ Off-peak hours logic working (8 min frequency)
✓ Time conversion functions work correctly
✓ Time validation with proper HH:MM format checking
✓ Next train calculation accurate (Test: 09:18 → next at 09:20)
✓ Multiple subsequent trains shown (up to 5 trains displayed)
✓ Service restriction working (23:15 shows no service)
✓ First train at 06:00 baseline implemented
✓ Proper time formatting with leading zeros (09:18, not 9:18)

Strengths:
- Robust time validation function
- Clean time formatting
- Accurate frequency calculations
- Shows multiple upcoming trains

SCORE: 30/30
Assessment: Flawless schedule logic implementation


3. JOURNEY PLANNER (25 marks)
-----------------------------
✓ Direct route planning works (Kirti Nagar → Rajiv Chowk)
✓ Interchange route planning works (Dwarka → IIT Delhi via Janakpuri West)
✓ BFS algorithm for shortest path implemented correctly
✓ Bidirectional graph construction for route finding
✓ Interchange delay (3 minutes) properly added
✓ Next train calculation integrated into journey planning
✓ Departure and arrival times calculated accurately
✓ Total travel time computed correctly
✓ Handles both same-line and cross-line journeys
✓ Route optimization finds best interchange point

Strengths:
- Sophisticated BFS-based routing algorithm
- Proper handling of bidirectional metro lines
- Accurate time calculations including interchange delays
- Clean separation of direct vs interchange journeys

Minor observations:
- When direct route exists on same line, correctly chooses it over interchange
- Interchange details shown only when necessary (good design)

SCORE: 25/25
Assessment: Excellent journey planner with optimal routing


4. CODE QUALITY (15 marks)
--------------------------
Strengths:
✓ Excellent modular structure with well-defined functions
✓ Clear, descriptive function names (loadmetro, planjourney, etc.)
✓ Proper separation of concerns (data loading, routing, UI)
✓ Good error handling with user-friendly messages
✓ Input validation (time format, station existence)
✓ Case-insensitive input handling (line_map, station_map)
✓ Clean data structures (nested dictionaries for efficient lookup)
✓ Proper use of data structures (queue for BFS, sets for interchanges)
✓ No bare except clauses - good practice
✓ Interactive menu system with clear options

Minor weaknesses:
- Limited inline comments explaining complex logic
- Some functions could benefit from docstrings
- Variable names could be more descriptive in places (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'i', 'j')

SCORE: 14/15
Assessment: Professional code quality with excellent structure


5. DOCUMENTATION (10 marks)
---------------------------
✓ TWO comprehensive README files provided (main and bonus)
✓ Clear project description and objectives
✓ Detailed instructions to run the program
✓ Data sources thoroughly documented
✓ All assumptions clearly explained:
  - Service hours
  - Train frequency (peak/off-peak)
  - Interchange handling
  - Route finding logic
  - Time format requirements
✓ Example usage with sample inputs and outputs
✓ Troubleshooting section included
✓ Features list provided
✓ Table of contents for easy navigation
✓ Well-formatted markdown with emojis and sections

Strengths:
- Very professional documentation
- Comprehensive coverage of all aspects
- Clear examples demonstrating usage
- Separate documentation for bonus features

SCORE: 10/10
Assessment: Exemplary documentation, exceeds requirements

                            BONUS FEATURES EVALUATION
===============================================================================

BONUS IMPLEMENTED: YES - Additional Metro Lines

6. ENHANCEMENTS/BONUS (20 marks)
--------------------------------

Additional Lines Implemented:
✓ Airport Express Line (6 stations)
  - High-speed corridor from New Delhi to Dwarka Sector 21
  - Includes major stations like IGI Airport, Delhi Aerocity
  - Proper interchange integration

✓ Green Line (28 stations)  
  - Complete route from Kirti Nagar/Inderlok to Brigadier Hoshiyar Singh
  - Covers western Delhi region extensively
  - Multiple interchange points with other lines

Line Coverage Analysis:
- Blue Line: ✓ (Required)
- Magenta Line: ✓ (Required)
- Airport Express: ✓ (Bonus - complete line)
- Green Line: ✓ (Bonus - complete line)
