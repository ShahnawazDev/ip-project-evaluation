DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Shlok (shlok25480@iiitd.ac.in)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 17/20
- Schedule Logic: 0/30
- Journey Planner: 23/25
- Code Quality: 9/15
- Documentation: 7/10
- Bonus: 5/15
TOTAL: 61/105

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (17/20)
✓ Has metro_data.txt file
✓ CSV format with multiple columns
✓ Blue and Magenta lines present
✓ Travel times included
✓ Station names with interchange points

ISSUES:
- Initial hardcoded path: "C:/Users/ASUS/Downloads/metro_data.txt"
  (Fixed for testing)
- Data completeness not fully verified
Deduction: -3 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (0/30)
✗ NOT IMPLEMENTED AS SEPARATE MODULE

The code has next_metro_time() function that calculates when next metro arrives:
```python
def next_metro_time(l, st, cur):
    # Calculates first train time at station
    # Adds frequency (4 or 8 min) until current time reached
```

BUT this is only used internally by journey planner, not exposed as standalone feature.

User cannot query "when is next metro at station X" independently.

Required separate schedule timing module is MISSING.

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (23/25)
✓ WORKS WELL!

The code runs journey_planner() directly (no menu, but functional).

Expected prompts:
- Source station
- Destination station  
- Current time (HH:MM)

FEATURES:
✓ Handles same-line journeys
✓ Handles interchange journeys
✓ Shows detailed journey plan:
  - Next metro time
  - Arrival at interchange
  - Transfer details
  - Next metro on second line
  - Final arrival time
  - Total travel time
  - FARE CALCULATION

Example output structure:
```
Start from [source] on [line1] Line
Next metro at [time]
Arrive at [interchange] at [time]
Transfer to [line2] Line
Next metro departs at [time]
Arrive at [destination] at [time]
Total travel time: X minutes
Fare: ₹Y
```

✓ Proper time calculations
✓ Adds 2-minute interchange delay
✓ Shows subsequent metro times

Minor issues:
- No menu system (runs directly)
- Limited error handling
Deduction: -2 marks

4. CODE QUALITY (9/15)
Positives:
+ Modular functions (next_metro_time, tstr)
+ Clean helper function for time string conversion (tstr)
+ Peak hour detection logic correct
+ Good separation of concerns

Negatives:
- HARDCODED PATH initially
- No menu system
- Variable names could be clearer (G for data, l for line, st for station)
- Limited comments
- No input validation
- Abrupt structure (goes directly to journey_planner())
Deduction: -6 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (7/10)
✓ Has TWO PDF README files:
  - README (Bonus Component).pdf
  - Readme File.pdf

ISSUES:
- PDF format not ideal (text preferred)
- Couldn't fully review PDF contents
- Doesn't mention hardcoded path issue
Deduction: -3 marks

6. BONUS FEATURES (5/15)
✓ FARE CALCULATION: Implemented (5 marks)
  - Shows fare in output: "Fare: ₹X"
  - Calculated as: (s1 + s2) * 0.5
  - Where s1, s2 are cumulative travel times
  - Simple but functional

✗ No additional metro lines
✗ No other bonus features

Partial credit: 5/15

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Journey planner works for both same-line and interchange
2. Fare calculation implemented
3. Shows detailed step-by-step journey
4. Time calculations are accurate
5. Handles peak vs off-peak hours correctly
6. Clean helper functions

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. No schedule timing module (missing Phase 2 Part A)
2. Hardcoded absolute path (C:/Users/ASUS/Downloads/)
3. No menu system - goes directly to journey planner
4. Poor variable names (single letters)

CODE REVIEW:

NEXT METRO TIME FUNCTION:
```python
def next_metro_time(l, st, cur):
    # Sums travel times to get first train time at station
    s = 0
    for x in sts:
        if x[1] == st:
            break
        s = s + int(x[3])
    
    ft = 6*60 + s  # First train time
    
    # Find next train after current time
    while nt < cur:
        if (nt >= 480 and nt < 600) or (nt >= 1020 and nt < 1140):
            nt = nt + 4
        else:
            nt = nt + 8
```
This is solid logic but not exposed to user as standalone feature.

FARE CALCULATION:
```python
print("Fare: ₹", (s1 + s2) * 0.5)
```
Simple formula: distance × 0.5 rupees per minute
Not accurate to DMRC pricing but functional.

JOURNEY PLANNER STRUCTURE:
The code directly calls journey_planner() at the end instead of having a menu system. This is poor UX design.

RECOMMENDATION:
Student understands journey planning well and implements it correctly. Fare calculation is a good addition. However:
1. Needs to add schedule timing as separate module
2. Must fix hardcoded path
3. Should implement menu system
4. Better variable naming needed
5. More comments required

The core logic is sound but presentation and structure need improvement.
