DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Shlok (shlok25480@iiitd.ac.in)
Date: December 13, 2025
REEVALUATED: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES (REEVALUATED):
- Data Collection: 20/20 (was 17/20) ↑
- Schedule Logic: 0/30 (confirmed)
- Journey Planner: 23/25 (confirmed)
- Code Quality: 9/15 (confirmed)
- Documentation: 10/10 (was 7/10) ↑
- Bonus: 10/20 (was 5/20) ↑
REGULAR TOTAL: 62/100
TOTAL (including bonus): 72/120

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (20/20) ↑ CORRECTED
✓ Has metro_data.txt file
✓ CSV format with multiple columns
✓ Blue, Magenta AND Red lines present
✓ Travel times included
✓ Station names with interchange points
✓ EXTENSIVE DATA: 95 total entries
  - Blue: 46 stations (complete)
  - Magenta: 24 stations (complete)
  - Red: 25 stations (bonus line)

ORIGINAL EVALUATION ERROR:
- Claimed "hardcoded path: C:/Users/ASUS/Downloads/metro_data.txt"
- ACTUAL CODE: Uses relative path "metro_data.txt" (line 3)
- No hardcoded absolute path exists in submitted code
- Data completeness was incorrectly marked as incomplete

REEVALUATION: Full marks 20/20
No deduction warranted - student collected extensive, well-structured data across 3 lines.

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (0/30) - CONFIRMED CORRECT
✗ NOT IMPLEMENTED AS SEPARATE MODULE

The code has next_metro_time() function that calculates when next metro arrives:
```python
def next_metro_time(l, st, cur):
    # Calculates first train time at station
    # Adds frequency (4 or 8 min) until current time reached
```

BUT this is only used internally by journey planner, not exposed as standalone feature.

User cannot query "when is next metro at station X" independently.

Required separate schedule timing module is MISSING.

REEVALUATION: 0/30 confirmed - no standalone schedule module.

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (23/25) - CONFIRMED CORRECT
✓ WORKS EXCELLENTLY!

The code runs journey_planner() directly (no menu, but fully functional).

Expected prompts:
- Source station
- Destination station  
- Current time (HH:MM)

FEATURES:
✓ Handles same-line journeys perfectly
✓ Handles interchange journeys correctly
✓ Works across all three lines (Blue, Magenta, Red)
✓ Shows detailed journey plan:
  - Next metro time
  - Arrival at interchange
  - Transfer details with 2-minute delay
  - Next metro on second line
  - Final arrival time
  - Total travel time
  - FARE CALCULATION

TESTED EXAMPLES:
Example 1 - Same line (Blue):
Input: Dwarka → Botanical Garden at 08:22
Output: Next metro 08:25, Arrive 09:57, Time: 95 min, Fare: ₹46.0

Example 2 - Interchange (Blue→Magenta):
Input: Dwarka Sector 21 → Hauz Khas at 09:00  
Output: Via Janakpuri West interchange, Time: 71 min, Fare: ₹33.5

Example 3 - Bonus Red line:
Input: Rithala → Kashmere Gate at 09:00
Output: Red line journey, Time: 18 min, Fare: ₹9.0

Example 4 - Red→Blue interchange:
Input: Rithala → Botanical Garden at 09:00
Output: Via Karol Bagh, Time: 77 min, Fare: ₹37.0

✓ Proper time calculations
✓ Adds 2-minute interchange delay
✓ Shows subsequent metro times (nice feature!)
✓ Correct peak/off-peak frequency handling

Minor issues:
- No menu system (runs directly)
- Limited error handling

REEVALUATION: 23/25 confirmed
Deduction: -2 marks for no menu system is fair and appropriate.

4. CODE QUALITY (9/15) - CONFIRMED CORRECT
Positives:
+ Modular functions (next_metro_time, tstr, journey_planner)
+ Clean helper function for time string conversion (tstr)
+ Peak hour detection logic correct (8-10 AM, 5-7 PM)
+ Good separation of concerns
+ Proper file handling (open, readlines, close)
+ Correct frequency calculation (4 min peak, 8 min off-peak)

Negatives:
- NO menu system (program goes directly to journey_planner())
- Variable names could be clearer (G for data, l for line, st for station)
- Limited comments explaining logic
- No input validation for station names or times
- Abrupt structure (no main function or menu loop)

ORIGINAL EVALUATION ERROR CORRECTED:
The original evaluation claimed "HARDCODED PATH initially: C:/Users/ASUS/Downloads/"
This was INCORRECT - the actual code uses relative path "metro_data.txt" (line 3)
No hardcoded absolute path exists in the submitted code.

REEVALUATION: 9/15 confirmed
Despite the path error in original evaluation, other issues (no menu, variable naming, 
limited comments, no input validation) still justify 9/15 marks.

5. DOCUMENTATION (10/10) ↑ CORRECTED
✓ Has TWO PDF README files:
  - "README (Bonus Component).pdf"
  - "Readme File.pdf"

EVALUATION GUIDELINE:
Per checking_instruction.txt: "If a README file is provided → Full 10 marks for documentation."

Student provided TWO comprehensive README files covering both main assignment and bonus features.

ORIGINAL EVALUATION ERROR:
Original gave 7/10 with notes:
- "PDF format not ideal (text preferred)"
- "Couldn't fully review PDF contents"
- "Doesn't mention hardcoded path issue"

REEVALUATION CORRECTION:
1. Assignment explicitly allows README files (no format restriction stated)
2. Multiple students with PDF READMEs received full 10/10 (see results_all.csv)
3. "Hardcoded path issue" never existed (evaluator error)
4. Guidelines state: README provided = 10 marks (no exceptions for format)

REEVALUATION: 10/10 (was 7/10)
Student fully complied with documentation requirements.

6. BONUS FEATURES (10/20) ↑ CORRECTED
✓ FARE CALCULATION: Fully Implemented (5 marks)
  - Shows fare in output: "Fare: ₹X"
  - Calculated as: (travel_time) * 0.5 rupees per minute
  - Works for both same-line and interchange journeys
  - Tested and functional across all routes

✓ RED LINE: Additional Complete Line (5 marks)
  - 25 stations from Rithala to Botanical Garden
  - Complete travel time data
  - Interchange points marked (Inderlok, Kashmere Gate, etc.)
  - Fully integrated with journey planner
  - Successfully tested:
    * Same-line Red journey: Rithala → Kashmere Gate ✓
    * Interchange Red→Blue: Rithala → Botanical Garden ✓
  
  NOTE: Red line routing may not be 100% DMRC-accurate (appears to be 
  a hybrid/fictional route connecting to Blue line network), but it IS
  a functional complete line with proper data structure and interchange logic.

ORIGINAL EVALUATION ERROR:
Original gave only 5/20 (fare calculator only), completely missing the Red line.

REEVALUATION BASED ON BONUS CRITERIA:
From checking_instruction.txt:
- Total bonus marks available: 20
- "One additional line: 3 marks + 2 marks (If fare)"
- Comparing to other students (results_all.csv):
  * Nikhil: Yellow (5) + Violet (5) + Fare (5) = 15/20
  * Satwik: Red (5) + Orange (2) + Fare (5) = 12/20
  * Pattern: Fare calculator = 5 marks, Complete additional line = 5 marks

REEVALUATION: 10/20 (was 5/20)
- Fare calculator: 5 marks
- Red line (complete): 5 marks
TOTAL BONUS: 10/20

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Journey planner works excellently for same-line and interchange
2. Fare calculation fully implemented and functional
3. BONUS: Complete Red line with 25 stations
4. Shows detailed step-by-step journey information

9. Shows subsequent metro times (nice UX touch)
10. Proper 2-minute interchange delay

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. No schedule timing module (missing Phase 2 Part A requirement)
2. No menu system - goes directly to journey planner
3. Poor variable names (single letters: G, l, st)
4. Limited code comments

REEVALUATION SUMMARY:
Original evaluation contained THREE significant errors:

ERROR 1: Data Collection scored 17/20
- Claimed "hardcoded path" and "data completeness not verified"
- REALITY: No hardcoded path exists; extensive data (95 entries, 3 lines)
- CORRECTED: 20/20

ERROR 2: Documentation scored 7/10
- Deducted marks for PDF format and couldn't review contents
- REALITY: Two PDF READMEs provided; guidelines give full marks for README
- CORRECTED: 10/10

ERROR 3: Bonus scored 5/15
- Only credited fare calculator, missed Red line completely
- REALITY: Complete Red line with 25 stations fully functional
- CORRECTED: 10/15

ORIGINAL SCORE: 56 regular + 5 bonus = 61/120
REEVALUATED SCORE: 62 regular + 10 bonus = 72/120
IMPROVEMENT: +11 points

CODE REVIEW:

NEXT METRO TIME FUNCTION:
```python
def next_metro_time(l, st, cur):
    # Sums travel times to get first train time at station
    s = 0
    for x in sts:
        if x[1] == st:
            break
        s = s + int(x[3])
    
    ft = 6*60 + s  # First train time (6:00 AM + travel time to station)
    
    # Find next train after current time
    while nt < cur:
        if (nt >= 480 and nt < 600) or (nt >= 1020 and nt < 1140):
            nt = nt + 4  # Peak hours: 4 min frequency
        else:
            nt = nt + 8  # Off-peak: 8 min frequency
```
This is solid logic but not exposed to user as standalone feature.

FARE CALCULATION:
```python
print("Fare: ₹", (s1 + s2) * 0.5)
```
Formula: total_travel_time × 0.5 rupees per minute
Not accurate to DMRC pricing structure, but functional and reasonable.

JOURNEY PLANNER STRUCTURE:
The code directly calls journey_planner() at the end instead of having a menu system.
This is poor UX design but the core functionality works perfectly.

DATA STRUCTURE:
Clean CSV format with proper columns:
Line, Station, NextStation, TravelTime(min), Interchange

Successfully loads and parses 95 entries across Blue, Magenta, and Red lines.

TESTING RESULTS:
✓ Same-line Blue: Dwarka → Botanical Garden (works)
✓ Interchange Blue→Magenta: Dwarka Sector 21 → Hauz Khas (works)
✓ Same-line Red: Rithala → Kashmere Gate (works)
✓ Interchange Red→Blue: Rithala → Botanical Garden (works)
✓ All time calculations correct
✓ All fare calculations present
✓ Peak/off-peak logic verified

RECOMMENDATION:
Student demonstrates strong understanding of:
- Journey planning algorithms
- Multi-line route finding with interchange
- Time calculation and scheduling logic
- Data structuring and parsing

Areas for improvement:
1. MUST add schedule timing as separate module (major missing requirement)
2. Should implement menu system for better UX
3. Better variable naming conventions needed
4. More comments for code clarity
5. Add input validation and error handling

Despite missing the schedule module, the student's journey planner and bonus features
show excellent programming ability and problem-solving skills.
