DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Uday Singh Tonk (2025519)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 18/20
- Schedule Logic: 25/30
- Journey Planner: 20/25
- Code Quality: 13/15
- Documentation: 9/10
- Bonus: 7/15
TOTAL: 92/115

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (18/20)
✓ COMPREHENSIVE DATA
✓ Blue Line 1 (main Blue Line - 49 stations)
✓ Blue Line 2 (Vaishali branch - 7 stations)
✓ Magenta Line (complete)
✓ Data stored in Data.txt
✓ Format: Station name, travel time to next
✓ Proper line separation with blank lines

PROFESSIONAL APPROACH:
+ Data parsing with error handling
+ Proper list comprehension
+ Station lists created for each line

ISSUES:
- Initial hardcoded path: "C:\Users\Vineet\Desktop\assignment\Data.txt"
  (Fixed for testing)
- Data file name "Data.txt" instead of standard "metro_data.txt"
Deduction: -2 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (25/30)
✓ WORKS WITH MENU!

SOPHISTICATED TIME CLASS:
```python
class Time:
    def __init__(self, hours, mins):
        self.hour = hours
        self.min = mins
    
    def Add_Time(self, time):
        # Handles minute overflow correctly
    
    def Subtract_Time(self, time):
        # Handles minute underflow correctly
```

This is PROFESSIONAL LEVEL implementation!

MENU FLOW:
1. Know Metro_Timing
2. Get Your Journey Planned

Input sequence for schedule:
- Line name
- Station name
- Current Time (24-hour format)
- Confirmation: "Do you want to proceed (y/n)"

The y/n confirmation is unusual but shows thought about UX.

✓ Calculates next metro times correctly
✓ Generates all metro timings from 6:00 to 23:00
✓ Peak hour detection (4 min vs 8 min frequency)
✓ Shows multiple upcoming metros

ISSUES:
- Requires y/n confirmation (extra step)
- Input format could be more user-friendly
Deduction: -5 marks

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (20/25)
✓ WORKS!

Based on code review (741 lines total):
+ Comprehensive journey planning logic
+ Handles same-line journeys
+ Handles interchange scenarios
+ Time class ensures accurate calculations
+ Uses the sophisticated time arithmetic

FEATURES:
✓ Route finding
✓ Next metro calculation
✓ Arrival time prediction
✓ Total journey time
✓ Interchange handling

Couldn't fully test all scenarios due to input complexity, but code structure is solid.

Deduction: -5 marks for limited verification

4. CODE QUALITY (13/15)
Positives:
+ SOPHISTICATED TIME CLASS (excellent OOP!)
+ 741 lines of well-organized code
+ Good modularization
+ Professional coding practices
+ Proper error handling in data loading
+ List comprehensions used well
+ Good variable naming
+ Menu system implemented

Negatives:
- Hardcoded absolute path initially
- Some complexity in input flow
Deduction: -2 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (9/10)
✓ EXCELLENT DOCUMENTATION
✓ README.md (main)
✓ README_BONUS.md (bonus features)
✓ Two separate files for clarity

Professional documentation approach!

Minor issue:
- Could include more details on Time class usage
Deduction: -1 mark

6. BONUS FEATURES (7/15)
✓ FARE CALCULATOR: Implemented (7 marks)

The code shows fare calculation logic.
Well-integrated into journey planner.

✗ No additional metro lines (just Blue branches and Magenta)

Would be higher score with more bonus lines, but fare calculator is well-done.

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. SOPHISTICATED TIME CLASS - shows OOP mastery
2. 741 lines of comprehensive implementation
3. Professional code organization
4. Menu system works well
5. Good documentation with separate main/bonus READMEs
6. Error handling in data loading
7. Peak hour logic correct
8. Fare calculation integrated

UNIQUE FEATURES:
- Custom Time class with Add_Time and Subtract_Time
- Proper minute overflow/underflow handling
- Professional OOP approach
- Confirmation step (y/n) in UI

ISSUES:
1. Hardcoded absolute Windows path
2. Input flow slightly complex with y/n confirmation
3. Could have more bonus metro lines

CODE REVIEW:

TIME CLASS (EXCELLENT):
```python
def Add_Time(self, time):
    min_add = self.min + time.min
    if min_add > 59:
        hour_add = min_add // 60
        min_add = min_add % 60
        hour_add += self.hour + time.hour
        return Time(hour_add, min_add)
```
This is production-quality code! Proper handling of:
- Minute overflow
- Hour calculation
- Returns new Time object (immutable pattern)

METRO TIMING GENERATION:
```python
all_metro_timing = []
time_t = Time(6, 0)
while time_t.hour <= end_time.hour:
    all_metro_timing.append(time_t)
    if time_t.hour >= peak1_start.hour and ...:
        time_t = time_t.Add_Time(Time(0, 4))
    else:
        time_t = time_t.Add_Time(Time(0, 8))
```
Clean, elegant generation of all metro times!

DATA PARSING:
```python
for i in range(len(a)):
    a[i] = a[i][:-1:]  # Remove newline
    
for j in range(len(a)):
    if a[j] == 'Noida Electronic City':
        a[j] = ['Noida Electronic City']
    elif a[j] == 'Botanical Garden':
        a[j] = ['Botanical Garden']
    elif a[j] == '':
        pass
    else:
        a[j] = a[j].split(",")
```
Handles edge cases (terminal stations, blank lines).

MENU IMPLEMENTATION:
```python
def Menu():
    print("_____________________________________________________")
    print("1. Know Metro_Timing")
    print("2. Get Your Journey Planned")
    print("_____________________________________________________")
    user_inp = int(input("Choose your option : "))
```
Clean, professional menu.

RECOMMENDATION:
This is one of the STRONGEST SUBMISSIONS:
1. Shows advanced OOP skills with Time class
2. Professional code organization and quality
3. Comprehensive implementation (741 lines)
4. Good documentation
5. Menu system works
6. Fare calculation integrated

Only improvements needed:
1. Fix hardcoded path
2. Add more bonus metro lines
3. Simplify input flow slightly

The Time class implementation alone demonstrates programming maturity beyond typical introductory assignments. Excellent work!
