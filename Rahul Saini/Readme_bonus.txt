in the bonus component of this assigment i have done the following things:

@ I HAVE INCLUDED FAI CALCULATION BASED ON NO THE DURATION YOU SPEND IN THE metro
  The function FAIRCAL() calculate the fair of ride, it charges a base fair of 11 rupee and increases the fair bases on
  the time spent in metro

@ 2 EXTRA METRO LINES
i have also included to extra metro line ie YELLOW and RED ,the addition of these two lines increases the no of 
interchange station make it difficult to calculate the shortest path but by using cases we can calculate the 
path with shorted duration path.

@ERROR IDENTIFICATION
i have included a function named station_checker() which can check if the station is present in a metro line.and 
also checks for invalid text using ValueError and returnes station not found.

@ WAITING TIME OF METRO ON EACH station
i have considred a waiting of 1 min on each stopping station to make the stimulation more realistic.

@metro STATUS
it checks if the metro is avilable or not

@ MY OUTPUT ALSO STATES THE NO OF INTERCHANGE STATION AND TNE NAME OF EACH INTERCHANGE STATION MAKING IT MORE 
HELPFULL FOR THE USER TO NAVIGATE
