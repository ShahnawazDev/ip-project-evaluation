========================================
DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Parag Prasun (2025354)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 17/20
- Schedule Logic: 30/30
- Journey Planner: 0/25
- Code Quality: 8/15
- Documentation: 7/10
- Bonus: 0/15
TOTAL: 62/100

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (17/20)
✓ Blue Line data present
✓ Magenta Line data present
✓ CSV-style format with line names as section headers
✓ Travel times included
✓ Interchange points marked
ISSUES:
- Incomplete data (only 245 lines, truncated)
- Some Blue line segments (Blue1-Blue5) have inconsistent naming
- Missing complete station list for full network
Deduction: -3 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (30/30)
✓ WORKS PERFECTLY
Test: Blue Line, Rajiv Chowk, 09:18
Output: "Next metro at: 09:18, Subsequent metros at 09:22,09:26,09:30,09:34..."
✓ Correct peak hour detection (4 min intervals at 09:18)
✓ Recursive functions handle different time periods correctly
✓ Handles edge cases (service end times)
✓ Multiple subsequent train times shown
EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (0/25)
✗ CRITICAL BUG - DOES NOT PRINT OUTPUT
The q2() function calculates the journey and returns values, but main menu never prints the returned value.
Code issue at line ~520:
```python
elif op==2:
    q2()  # <-- Returns value but doesn't print it!
    print()
```
Should be: print(q2())

Testing showed function calculates correctly internally but user sees no output.
This is a CRITICAL failure of core functionality.

4. CODE QUALITY (8/15)
Positives:
+ Modular function design
+ Good variable naming in some areas
Negatives:
- Inconsistent code style
- Many redundant recursive functions (case1, case2peak, case3, case4peak, case5)
- Could use loops instead of 5 separate functions
- The q2() function is overly complex (150+ lines)
- Limited comments
- Output bug shows lack of testing

5. DOCUMENTATION (7/10)
✓ Has README files (PDF format)
✓ Explains approach and data structure
ISSUES:
- PDF format not ideal (plain text preferred)
- Doesn't mention the critical output bug
- Lacks execution instructions
Deduction: -3 marks

6. BONUS FEATURES (0/15)
✗ No additional metro lines
✗ No fare calculation
✗ No extra features implemented

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Schedule logic is excellently implemented
2. Peak/off-peak hour detection works perfectly
3. Shows multiple subsequent metro times
4. Clean recursive approach for time calculations

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Journey planner output bug makes it completely non-functional for users
2. Despite having working logic, the failure to print results is unacceptable
3. This appears to be a simple oversight but renders the feature useless

CODE REVIEW:
The ride_plan() function inside q2() does all calculations correctly but returns a value that's never printed. This single-line bug costs 25 marks.

RECOMMENDATION:
Student clearly understands the problem and has working logic, but failed to properly integrate and test the complete system. The output bug is a critical oversight.
