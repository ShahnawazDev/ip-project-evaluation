ASSINGNMENT PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Delhi Metro Route and Schedule Simulator 
 
Objective 
You are required to design and implement a Python program that simulates the working of the 
Delhi Metro system, focusing on the Blue Line and Magenta Line. 
Your program should: 
1.  Load and store the metro stop data (station names, order, and travel times). 
2.  Compute when the next metro will arrive at any given station. 
3.  Allow a rider to plan a journey, including interchange between Blue and Magenta 
lines. 
 
Phase 1: Data Collection  
Before writing any code, you must collect and structure real-world data for the Delhi Metro. 
Lines to Include 
●  Blue Line (Dwarka Sector 21 ↔ Noida Electronic City / Vaishali) 
●  Magenta Line (Janakpuri West ↔ Botanical Garden) 
Data to Collect for Each Line 
Attribute  Description 
Station Order  All station names in correct travel order 
Travel Time  Approximate time (in minutes) between consecutive stations 
Interchange 
Points 
Stations where transfer between Blue and Magenta is possible (e.g., 
Janakpuri West and Botanical Garden) 
You can collect data from: 
●  The official DMRC website 
Deliverable 
Create a data file in text format, i.e. as metro_data.txt  
Include all related information which you think is required for your program. For example: 
 
Line,                 Station,                NextStation,     TravelTime(min),   Interchange Point 
Blue,          Dwarka Sector 21,         Dwarka,                       3                         No 
Blue,              Dwarka,                 Rajouri Garden,               5                         No 
Magenta,     Janakpuri West,           Palam,                         4                         Yes 
 
You may save it as you feel is easy/efficient for you. There is no fixed  
 
 
Phase 2: Program Functionality 
In this phase you will implement two functionalities: 
1.  Metro Timings Module: In this part, you will load your station and travel-time data to 
calculate when the next train will arrive at any station based on the current time. 
2.  Ride journey planner: Here, you will build a program that finds the best route between 
two stations, showing total travel time, interchange points, and when the rider can catch 
the next train. 
 
Metro Timings 
●  Start time: 06:00 AM 
●  End time: 11:00 PM 
●  Frequency: 
○  Off-peak hours: every 8 minutes 
○  Peak hours (8–10 AM and 5–7 PM): every 4 minutes 
The program must compute when the next metro will arrive at a given station based on current 
time. This information will be inferred from the file you have created in the first phase.  
Note: you will not use any libraries such as pickle, pandas, numpy etc. You are allowed Only 
basic file modes (read, write, append). 
Example: 
User Input: 
Line = Blue 
Station = Rajiv Chowk 
Current time = 09:18 
 
Output: 
Next metro at 09:20 
Subsequent metros at 09:24, 09:28, ... 
 
Rider Journey Planner 
User Input: 
Source: Dwarka 
Destination: Botanical Garden 
Time of travel: 08:22 
Your program should: 
1.  Identify whether the route is on a single line or requires interchange. 
2.  Calculate: 
○  Next available metro at source 
○  Estimated arrival time at each station 
○  If an interchange is needed, determine: 
■  Where to change (e.g., Janakpuri West) 
■  Next metro on the connecting line based on arrival time 
○  Final arrival time at destination  
Example Output: 
Journey Plan: 
Start at Dwarka (Blue Line) 
Next metro at 08:24 
Arrive at Janakpuri West at 08:39 
Transfer to Magenta Line 
Next Magenta metro departs at 08:42 
Arrive at Botanical Garden at 09:15 
Total travel time: 51 minutes 
 
Service Restrictions 
Your program may handle: 
●  Display “No service available” if time is before 06:00 AM or after 11:00 PM 
●  Add a few minutes interchange delay at transfer stations depending on the time 
provided on the official website.  
 
Optional Enhancements: Bonus 
●  Add more lines (e.g., Yellow or Green Line) 
●  Include fare calculation based on travel distance or time 
●  Any other functionality, which you feel is relevant. 
 
 
Phase 3: Documentation & Submission  
Each student must submit: 
1.  Python Source Code: metro_simulator.py 
2.  Data File: metro_data.txt 
3.  README File: Include 
○  Data sources 
○  Assumptions made 
○  Instructions to run the program 
4.  (Optional) A screenshot or short demo video
