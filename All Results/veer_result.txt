DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Veer Pratap (2025539)
Date: December 13, 2025 (REEVALUATED)
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 20/20
- Schedule Logic: 15/30
- Journey Planner: 23/25
- Code Quality: 9/15
- Documentation: 10/10
- Bonus: 0/20
REGULAR TOTAL: 77/100
TOTAL: 77/120

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (20/20)
✓ Has metro_data.txt file
✓ Blue and Magenta lines present
✓ CSV format with proper structure
✓ Travel times included
✓ Station names and connections
✓ 80 unique stations verified:
  - Blue Line 1: 50 stations (Dwarka Sector 21 → Noida Electronic City)
  - Blue Line 2: 7 stations (Yamuna Bank → Vaishali)
  - Magenta Line: 25 stations (Janakpuri West → Botanical Garden)

EXCELLENT DATA COLLECTION - Complete and accurate.
No deduction.

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (15/30)
✓ IMPLEMENTED AND DISPLAYS OUTPUT (but not as standalone module)

COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION:
✓ frequency() function (lines 16-19):
  - Correct peak hours: 8-10 AM & 5-7 PM → 4 minutes
  - Normal hours: all other times → 8 minutes
  - Service hours: 6 AM - 11 PM validated

✓ next_metro_timing() function (lines 29-34):
  - Calculates next metro based on current time and frequency
  - Uses modulo arithmetic for correct timing

✓ hourconverter() function (lines 36-39):
  - Converts minutes to HH:MM format for display

✓ DISPLAYS TO USER (lines 76, 202, 280):
  ```python
  print(f"Next metro at {hourconverter(next_metro_time)}")
  for i in range(1,3):
      metro_time = next_metro_time + (i * freq)
      print(f"Next to next metro {i}: {hourconverter(metro_time)}")
  ```
  - Shows next metro time
  - Shows 3 subsequent metro times

✗ NOT A STANDALONE MODULE:
  - Schedule timing embedded within journey planner
  - No menu option for "check metro timings"
  - Cannot query schedule independently

AWARDED 15/30: Complete schedule logic with correct peak/off-peak handling
AND displays output to user, but not accessible as standalone feature.

This is consistent with Rahul (20/30) and Sadaanant (20/30) who have similar implementations.

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (23/25)
✓ WORKS EXCELLENTLY FOR SAME-LINE, SINGLE-INTERCHANGE, AND DOUBLE-INTERCHANGE!

NO MENU - Expects inputs upfront:
- Current Station
- Final Station  
- Current time (24-hour format)

COMPREHENSIVE FUNCTIONALITY:
✓ Handles same-line journeys (e.g., Blue1 to Blue1)
✓ Handles single-interchange journeys (e.g., Blue1 to Magenta)
✓ Handles double-interchange journeys (e.g., Blue2 → Blue1 → Magenta)
✓ Shows next 3 metro departure times at source
✓ Calculates optimal routes when multiple interchange options exist
✓ Shows arrival time at each interchange station
✓ Displays interchange walking times (5 or 10 minutes)
✓ Shows which line to transfer to
✓ Displays next metro departure time at interchange
✓ Calculates total travel time
✓ Shows final arrival time

SOPHISTICATED ROUTING:
+ Compares multiple routes and selects optimal path
+ Handles bidirectional travel correctly
+ Properly accounts for interchange delays
+ Shows detailed step-by-step journey information

ISSUES:
- No menu system (expects all inputs upfront)
- Input structure makes testing less flexible
Deduction: -2 marks

4. CODE QUALITY (9/15)
Positives:
+ Clean structure visible in code
+ Proper time conversion logic
+ Good variable naming in parts
+ Handles 24-hour time format

Negatives:
- No menu system (expects 3 inputs upfront)
- Limited error handling
- Code crashes if input format wrong
- No validation for station existence
- Limited comments
- Poor input handling causes ValueError on wrong format
Deduction: -6 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (10/10)
✓ Has comprehensive README.txt file

ACCORDING TO GRADING GUIDELINES:
"If a README file is provided → Full 10 marks for documentation."

README INCLUDES:
✓ Features description
✓ Metro lines and stations listed
✓ Metro frequency schedule (peak vs normal hours)
✓ Interchange stations with walking times
✓ Data sources cited (DMRC website + IIT Delhi PDF)
✓ How to use instructions with clear input format examples
✓ Core functions explained (frequency, next_metro_timing, hourconverter)
✓ Data structure description
✓ Error handling features documented
✓ Limitations acknowledged

EXCELLENT DOCUMENTATION - Complete and well-structured.
No deduction - Full marks as per guidelines.

6. BONUS FEATURES (0/15)
✗ No additional metro lines
✗ No fare calculation
✗ No extra features

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. EXCELLENT data collection: 80 complete stations across 3 line variants
2. COMPREHENSIVE journey planner with same-line, single-interchange, AND double-interchange support
3. Sophisticated route optimization (compares multiple paths, selects optimal)
4. **SCHEDULE LOGIC IMPLEMENTED**: Shows next metro time + 3 subsequent times at source station
5. Correct peak/off-peak frequency logic (4 min vs 8 min)
6. Detailed interchange information (walking times, next metro times at interchanges)
7. COMPREHENSIVE README with all required information
8. Professional time calculations and formatting
9. Handles bidirectional travel correctly
10. Service hours validation (6 AM - 11 PM)

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Schedule logic not exposed as STANDALONE MODULE (lacks menu option for independent query) - PARTIAL DEDUCTION
2. No menu system - expects all inputs upfront
3. Hardcoded file path (line 44: "C:/Users/Veer Pratap/OneDrive/Documents/metro_data.txt")
4. Limited input validation and error handling
5. Crashes with IndexError if time format is wrong (lines 3-5)
6. No try/except blocks

CODE REVIEW:

INPUT STRUCTURE:
```python
current_station = input("Enter Current Station:")
final_station = input("Enter Final Station:")
current_time = input("Current time(24 hour format):")
current_hour = int(current_time[0])  # <-- CRASHES if format wrong!
```

ISSUES:
- Assumes current_time[0] is valid
- No try/except handling
- No format validation
- Crashes immediately if user enters wrong format

This is what caused testing failure - the code expects specific input format but doesn't validate it.

JOURNEY DETAILS:
The code shows excellent attention to detail in journey output:
- Lists every station
- Shows time at each station
- Progressive journey tracking
- Good for user experience

But this feature alone doesn't make up for:
- Missing schedule module
- No menu system
- Poor error handling

RECOMMENDATION:
The student demonstrates STRONG understanding of both schedule logic AND journey planning with sophisticated routing logic that handles complex multi-interchange scenarios. The data collection is complete and accurate. The documentation is comprehensive and meets all requirements.

SCHEDULE LOGIC IS IMPLEMENTED with correct peak/off-peak frequencies and DISPLAYS output to users, but lacks standalone module structure (no menu option). This is similar to Rahul and Sadaanant's implementations.

If schedule timing were exposed as a standalone module with menu:
- Would score 92/100
- With input validation: could reach 95+/100

The journey planner implementation is MORE sophisticated than many submissions (handles double-interchange optimally), schedule logic works correctly, and the README is excellent.

CORRECTED SCORES:
- Data Collection: 17→20 (+3 marks for verified complete data)
- Schedule Logic: 0→15 (+15 marks for implemented logic that displays to user)
- Journey Planner: 21→23 (+2 marks for double-interchange capability)
- Documentation: 6→10 (+4 marks per grading guidelines)
TOTAL CHANGE: 53→77 (+24 marks)

CODE IMPROVEMENT NEEDED:
```python
# Current (crashes):
current_hour = int(current_time[0])

# Should be:
try:
    h, m = current_time.split(":")
    current_hour = int(h)
    current_minute = int(m)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid time format. Use HH:MM")
    exit()
```

With these fixes and addition of schedule module, this could be a good submission.
