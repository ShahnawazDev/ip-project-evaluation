DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Prashun Jha (2025390)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 20/20
- Schedule Logic: 15/30
- Journey Planner: 22/25
- Code Quality: 10/15
- Documentation: 10/10
- Bonus: 0/20
REGULAR TOTAL: 77/100
TOTAL: 77/120

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (20/20)
✓ Blue-3 Line (main Blue Line)
✓ Blue-4 Line (Vaishali branch)
✓ Magenta Line complete
✓ 81 stations total with good coverage
✓ CSV format with proper headers
✓ Travel times realistic (1-5 minutes)
✓ Interchange points marked
ISSUES:
- Slightly incomplete coverage of full network
- Screenshot included but not needed
Deduction: -3 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (15/30)
✓ IMPLEMENTED AND DISPLAYS OUTPUT (but not as standalone module)

COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION:
✓ check_gap() function (lines 41-49):
  - Converts 12-hour to 24-hour format for calculations
  - Correct peak hours: 8-10 AM & 5-7 PM → 4 minutes
  - Normal hours: all other times → 8 minutes
  ```python
  if (8 <= h24 < 10) or (17 <= h24 < 19):
      return 4
  else:
      return 8
  ```

✓ add_minutes() function (lines 51-58):
  - Handles time arithmetic correctly
  - Proper hour/minute overflow handling

✓ DISPLAYS TO USER:
  Line 175: `print(f"Next metro at {current_hour:02d}:{current_minute:02d}")`
  Line 210: `print(f"Next {n_line} metro departs at {current_hour:02d}:{current_minute:02d}")`
  
  Calculates waiting time based on current time modulo frequency:
  ```python
  gap = check_gap(current_hour, am_pm)
  rem = current_minute % gap
  wait = 0
  if rem != 0:
      wait = gap - rem
  current_hour, current_minute = add_minutes(current_hour, current_minute, wait)
  print(f"Next metro at {current_hour:02d}:{current_minute:02d}")
  ```

✗ NOT A STANDALONE MODULE:
  - Schedule timing embedded within journey planner
  - No menu option for "check metro timings"
  - Cannot query schedule independently
  - Does not show multiple subsequent metro times

AWARDED 15/30: Complete schedule logic with correct peak/off-peak handling
AND displays next metro time to user, but not accessible as standalone feature.

This is consistent with Rahul (20/30), Sadaanant (20/30), Veer (20/30), 
Shlok (20/30), and Vivaswat (20/30) who have similar implementations.

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (22/25)
✓ WORKS WELL!

Test 1 - Same Line: Dwarka Sector - 21 → Botanical Garden at 08:22
Output:
- Journey Plan shown
- Next metro at 08:24
- Arrive at Botanical Garden at 09:43
- Total travel time: 81 minutes
✓ Correct calculation

Test 2 - Interchange: Dwarka Sector - 21 → Hauz Khas
Output:
- Shows transfer at Botanical Garden
- Adds 10 minutes for walking/interchange
- Next Magenta metro departs at 09:56
- Final arrival at Hauz Khas at 10:30
✓ Handles interchange correctly

EXCELLENT FEATURES:
+ BFS-style pathfinding algorithm
+ Handles forward/backward traversal on lines
+ Proper interchange detection
+ 10-minute interchange delay included

Minor issues:
- Uses 12-hour time format requiring AM/PM input (non-standard)
Deduction: -3 marks

4. CODE QUALITY (10/15)
Positives:
+ Good modular function design
+ BFS pathfinding is well-implemented
+ check_gap() function handles peak hours correctly
+ add_minutes() helper function is clean
+ Good variable names

Negatives:
- HARDCODED ABSOLUTE PATH: "/Users/prashunjha/Downloads/delhi_metro/metro_data.txt"
  This prevents code from running on any other system!
- No menu system (expects all inputs upfront)
- Some redundant nested loops
- Could use more comments
Deduction: -5 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (10/10)
✓ Good README.md file provided
✓ Explains approach and design decisions
✓ Mentions DMRC website as data source
✓ Discusses why list-of-lists was chosen over dictionary
✓ Clear feature description
✓ Provides context on how the program works

Per evaluation guidelines: "If a README file is provided → Full 10 marks for documentation"

MINOR ISSUES (not penalized per guidelines):
- Could include more explicit step-by-step execution instructions
- No mention of hardcoded path issue (though evaluator fixed it)

6. BONUS FEATURES (0/15)
✗ No additional metro lines
✗ No fare calculation
✗ No extra features

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Journey planner is sophisticated with BFS algorithm
2. Handles interchange intelligently
3. Good code structure and modularization
4. Thoughtful README explaining design choices
5. **SCHEDULE LOGIC IMPLEMENTED**: Shows next metro time with correct peak/off-peak frequency
6. Proper waiting time calculation based on current time modulo frequency
7. Displays next metro at interchanges

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Schedule logic not exposed as STANDALONE MODULE (lacks menu option for independent query)
2. Hardcoded Mac-specific absolute path makes code non-portable (fixed for testing)
3. No menu system - all inputs must be provided upfront

CODE REVIEW:
The metro_simulator() function implements an excellent pathfinding algorithm:
- Uses BFS-style exploration with visited tracking
- Properly detects line changes
- Calculates waiting times with peak hour awareness
- Adds realistic 10-minute interchange delay

However, the missing schedule timing module is a critical omission.

RECOMMENDATION:
Student shows strong understanding of graph algorithms, route planning, and schedule timing logic. The check_gap() function correctly implements peak/off-peak frequencies and displays next metro times to users. However, this functionality is embedded within the journey planner rather than exposed as a standalone module. Also needs to fix hardcoded path and add proper menu interface.

CORRECTED EVALUATION:
- Schedule Logic: 0→15 (+15 marks) for implemented logic that displays to user
- Total: 59→74 (+15 marks)

========================================
MARKS DEDUCTION SUMMARY (FOR QUICK REFERENCE):
-----------------------------------------------
Total Deductions: -23 marks (Regular: 74/100, Bonus: 0/20, Total: 74/100)

Breakdown:
• Schedule Logic: -15 (check_gap() function correctly implements peak/off-peak 
  4min/8min frequency and DISPLAYS next metro time to user at lines 175/210, but 
  NOT exposed as standalone module - no menu option for independent schedule queries)
• Journey Planner: -3 (uses non-standard 12-hour time format requiring AM/PM input)
• Code Quality: -5 (hardcoded Mac absolute path "/Users/prashunjha/Downloads/...", 
  no menu system - expects all inputs upfront)
• Bonus: -20 (no bonus features attempted)

Key Achievement: Strong BFS-based pathfinding with proper interchange handling 
(10-min delay). Schedule logic IMPLEMENTED with correct peak/off-peak calculation 
and displays output, but embedded in journey planner instead of standalone module.
