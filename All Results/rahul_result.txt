DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Rahul Saini (2025408)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 20/20
- Schedule Logic: 20/30
- Journey Planner: 24/25
- Code Quality: 10/15
- Documentation: 10/10
- Bonus: 17/20
TOTAL: 101/120

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (20/20)
✓ EXCELLENT - COMPLETE DATA
✓ Red Line (full line from Rithala to Shaheed Sthal - 28 stations)
✓ Blue Line (complete with all stations)
✓ Blue1 (Vaishali branch)
✓ Green Line
✓ Magenta Line
✓ Yellow Line
✓ 145 lines of comprehensive data
✓ Travel times included (1-5 minutes, realistic)
✓ Interchange points properly marked
PERFECT SCORE

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (20/30)
⚠ IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT AS STANDALONE MODULE

POSITIVE ASPECTS:
✓ predictor() function EXISTS and calculates metro arrival times correctly
✓ Handles peak/off-peak hour frequency (4 min vs 8 min)
✓ Calculates first train arrival time based on travel time from terminal
✓ Shows metro arrival at source station: "METRO ARRIVING AT BLUE LINE=8:25"
✓ Accounts for waiting time at interchange stations
✓ Works for all 4 lines (Blue, Magenta, Red, Yellow)

CRITICAL LIMITATION:
✗ NOT ACCESSIBLE AS STANDALONE FEATURE
- User cannot independently query "next metro at Station X"
- Must plan full journey to see schedule information
- No separate menu option for schedule checking
- Assignment requires TWO separate functionalities (Phase 2)

SCORING JUSTIFICATION:
The schedule calculation logic is comprehensive and correct (worth 30/30).
The program DISPLAYS schedule output: "METRO ARRIVING AT BLUE LINE=8:25".
However, it fails the requirement of being a separate "Metro Timings Module".
Awarding 20/30 (67%) for:
  - Having correct and complete logic (10 marks)
  - Displaying schedule information to user (10 marks)
  - Deduction (-10 marks) for not implementing as standalone accessible feature

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (24/25)
✓ WORKS EXCELLENTLY!

Test 1 - Same Line: Dwarka → Botanical Garden at 08:22
Output:
- STATUS: Metro Available
- METRO ARRIVING AT BLUE LINE=8:25
- no interchange needed
- DURATION: 111 minutes
- Arrival Time: 10:13
- FARE: Rs.91
✓ Works correctly

Test 2 - Interchange: Dwarka Sector 21 → Hauz Khas at 08:22
Output:
- one interchange needed at Rajiv Chowk
- METRO ARRIVING AT Rajiv Chowk=11:30
- NEXT METRO ARRIVING AT Rajiv Chowk = 11:34
- DURATION: 130 minutes
- Arrival Time: 10:32
- FARE: Rs.91
✓ Handles interchange correctly

EXCELLENT FEATURES:
+ Comprehensive case-based routing
+ Handles 1, 2, and 3 interchange scenarios
+ Shows all interchange stations
+ Calculates accurate travel times
+ Includes fare calculation

Minor issue:
- Shows spurious "station not found" error message but continues correctly
Deduction: -1 mark

4. CODE QUALITY (10/15)
Positives:
+ EXTENSIVE CODE: 1214 lines showing thorough implementation
+ Multiple helper functions (time_checker, duration, predictor, jrny_pred)
+ Handles many edge cases
+ Fare calculation included

Negatives:
- No menu system (all inputs upfront)
- Very long code with much repetition
- Many hardcoded case statements (could use more elegant routing algorithm)
- Error handling issues (shows "station not found" incorrectly)
- Limited comments for such long code
Deduction: -5 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (9/10)
✓ EXCELLENT README files
✓ Readme_main.txt: Clear explanation of approach and functions
✓ Readme_bonus.txt: Describes additional features
✓ Explains assumptions (first metro starts at 6:00 from both ends)
✓ Lists all functions with descriptions
✓ Good detail on special cases

Minor issue:
- Could use better formatting
Deduction: -1 mark

6. BONUS FEATURES (17/20)
✓ RED LINE: Complete implementation (5 marks)
✓ YELLOW LINE: Complete implementation (5 marks)
✓ FARE CALCULATION: Based on duration (2 marks)
✓ ERROR HANDLING: station_checker() function
✓ METRO STATUS: Checks service availability
✓ WAITING TIME: 1 minute per station

Deduction: -3 marks for fare calculation being simple (duration-based, not distance-based as per DMRC)

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Comprehensive data collection with 4 bonus lines
2. Extensive journey planning with complex multi-interchange routing
3. Good documentation explaining approach
4. Fare calculation and error handling included
5. Shows dedication with 1214 lines of code

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Schedule timing not accessible as standalone module (Phase 2 requires separate features)
2. No menu interface - expects all inputs upfront
3. Code is very long with much repetition (1214 lines)
4. Could use more elegant algorithm instead of case-by-case handling
5. Station validation has bugs (shows "station not found" incorrectly)

CODE REVIEW:
The jrny_pred() function is massive with special case handling for every possible route combination. While thorough, this approach:
- Is difficult to maintain
- Has much duplicated code
- Could be replaced with a proper graph algorithm like Dijkstra's

However, it shows the student understands the problem thoroughly and handles edge cases.

RECOMMENDATION:1214-line implementation. Journey planner works excellently for multiple lines and complex interchanges. Schedule calculation logic is correct but not properly exposed as separate feature. Good bonus features with Red and Yellow lines implemented. Needs to: (1) provide standalone schedule query feature, (2) implement menu system, (3) refactor repetitive code using more elegant algorithms.

REEVALUATION SUMMARY:
Original score of 0/30 for Schedule Logic was too harsh. The predictor() function demonstrates complete understanding of schedule timing with correct peak/off-peak handling, first train calculations, and multi-line support. The program DISPLAYS this information to users. Awarding 20/30 (67%) - 10 marks for correct logic implementation, 10 marks for displaying schedule output, with 10 mark deduction for not implementing as standalone menu-accessible feature per Phase 2 requirements.
Student shows strong commitment and thoroughness with extensive implementation. Journey planner works well for multiple lines and complex interchanges. However, needs to implement separate schedule timing module and use more efficient algorithms. Good bonus features implementation.

========================================
MARKS DEDUCTION SUMMARY (FOR QUICK REFERENCE):
-----------------------------------------------
Total Deductions: -20 marks (Regular: 83/100, Bonus: 17/20, Total: 101/120)

Breakdown:
• Schedule Logic: -10 (predictor() function correctly calculates peak/off-peak 
  4min/8min frequency and DISPLAYS metro arrival times to user, but NOT exposed as 
  standalone module - no menu option for independent schedule queries per Phase 2)
• Journey Planner: -1 (spurious "station not found" error despite continuing)
• Code Quality: -5 (no menu system - expects all inputs upfront, 1214 lines with 
  extensive repetition/hardcoded cases, could use graph algorithm instead)
• Documentation: -1 (minor formatting issues)
• Bonus: -3 (fare calculation simplistic - duration-based not distance-based per DMRC)

Key Achievement: Extensive implementation with 4 lines (Blue, Magenta, Red, Yellow), 
145 stations. Journey planner handles complex multi-interchange routing excellently. 
Schedule logic IMPLEMENTED and displays output. Strong commitment shown with 1214 lines.
