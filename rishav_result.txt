========================================
DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Rishav (rishav25425@iiitd.ac.in)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 18/20
- Schedule Logic: 28/30
- Journey Planner: 0/25
- Code Quality: 8/15
- Documentation: 5/10
- Bonus: 0/15
TOTAL: 59/100

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (18/20)
✓ Has metro_data.txt file
✓ CSV format with station, next station, travel time, line
✓ Travel times included
✓ Covers required lines

ISSUES:
- Data file not fully inspected (couldn't verify completeness)
- Format appears standard but limited visibility
Deduction: -2 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (28/30)
✓ WORKS CORRECTLY!

Test: Line=Blue, Station=Rajiv Chowk, Time=09:18
Output:
- "Next metro at 08:25"
- "Subsequent metro at 08:33,08:41"
✓ Shows multiple upcoming trains
✓ Peak hour detection working (4-min intervals at 09:18)

CODE ANALYSIS:
+ reach_time() function calculates time from start to station
+ Properly loops through metro_data.txt to sum travel times
+ Peak hour logic: (480 ≤ start_time ≤ 600) or (1020 ≤ start_time ≤ 1140)
+ Correctly adds 4 minutes during peak, 8 minutes off-peak
+ Shows 3 subsequent trains

Minor issues:
- Could show more subsequent trains
- Limited error handling
Deduction: -2 marks

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (0/25)
✗ INCOMPLETE - EXPLICITLY STATED IN CODE

From lines 71-164, the journey planner code is commented out with note:
```python
# SECOND PART = RIDE PLANNER PART
# AND THIS PART IS INCOMPLETE BUT ABOVE PART A IS COMPLETED AND GIVING CORRECT OUTPUT
```

Student acknowledges:
- "I have done second part seperatly"
- "pls run both codes seperatly"
- Functions are defined but not completed
- current_station and destiny_station variables defined but no logic

This is honest but incomplete submission.
0 marks for incomplete feature.

4. CODE QUALITY (8/15)
Positives:
+ Clean, readable code for Part 1
+ Good function names (time_min, min_time, reach_time)
+ Proper time conversion functions
+ Well-structured logic flow

Negatives:
- Journey planner incomplete
- No menu system (expects 3 inputs upfront: line, station, time)
- Limited comments
- No error handling for invalid inputs
- Doesn't check if station exists on specified line
Deduction: -7 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (5/10)
✓ Has readme file (readme file.txt)
✓ Includes 3 JPG screenshots showing:
  - Output examples
  - Code snippets
  - Test results

ISSUES:
- README content not fully reviewed
- Screenshots are helpful but don't replace written documentation
- No clear explanation of why Part 2 is incomplete
- Lacks execution instructions
Deduction: -5 marks

6. BONUS FEATURES (0/15)
✗ No additional metro lines
✗ No fare calculation
✗ No extra features

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Schedule logic (Part 1) is well-implemented and works correctly
2. Clean, understandable code structure
3. Honest about incomplete work (comments acknowledge it)
4. Time conversion functions are elegant
5. Peak hour detection works properly

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Journey planner (Part 2) completely incomplete
2. Code is commented out with explicit note about incompleteness
3. No menu system
4. No input validation

CODE REVIEW:

PART 1 - Schedule Logic (COMPLETE):
```python
def reach_time(current_station):
    # Sums travel times from start to current station
    # Returns time offset
```
This works well. The logic properly:
- Reads metro_data.txt
- Calculates cumulative travel time
- Determines when metros arrive at the station
- Shows multiple upcoming arrivals

PART 2 - Journey Planner (INCOMPLETE):
The code has skeleton definitions but no implementation:
- Variables defined (current_station, destiny_station)
- Helper functions copied from Part 1
- But no actual journey planning logic

RECOMMENDATION:
Student completed Phase 2 Part A (schedule logic) correctly but failed to complete Part B (journey planner). The code that exists is clean and functional. This appears to be a time management issue - student should have submitted partial journey planner implementation rather than leaving it completely undone. Honest about incompleteness but honesty doesn't substitute for completion.
