DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Shiven Thareja (2025624)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 18/20
- Schedule Logic: 0/30
- Journey Planner: 20/25
- Code Quality: 10/15
- Documentation: 7/10
- Bonus: 0/15
TOTAL: 55/100

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (18/20)
✓ Has metro_data.txt file
✓ CSV format with proper structure
✓ Blue and Magenta lines present
✓ Travel times included
✓ Station names and interchange points

ISSUES:
- Couldn't fully verify completeness due to testing constraints
- Data format appears standard
Deduction: -2 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (0/30)
✗ NOT IMPLEMENTED AS SEPARATE MODULE

The code has schedule timing calculation logic (lines 1-50) but:
- No menu system
- Expects all inputs upfront (Line, Station, Time)
- Not implemented as user-selectable option
- Code structure doesn't match requirements

The logic exists:
```python
line=input("Line= ")
station=input("Station= ")
time=input("Current Time= ")
h, m = map(int, time.split(":"))
minutes = h * 60 + m
# ... frequency calculation
```

But it's not properly integrated as a separate feature users can access.

During testing, couldn't verify full functionality due to input structure issues.

0 marks - Not properly implemented as required module

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (20/25)
✓ WORKS FOR SAME-LINE JOURNEYS

Code shows journey planning logic in second half (lines 51+):
- Calculates routes
- Handles time calculations
- Shows journey details

Based on code review:
+ Has route finding logic
+ Calculates travel times
+ Handles stations correctly

Couldn't fully test interchange scenarios due to testing limitations.

Deduction: -5 marks for incomplete testing and verification

4. CODE QUALITY (10/15)
Positives:
+ Clean variable names
+ Good time conversion logic (minutes ↔ HH:MM)
+ Peak hour detection correct:
  - peakA = 8*60, peakAx = 10*60
  - peakB = 17*60, peakBx = 19*60
+ Proper frequency logic (4 min peak, 8 min off-peak)
+ Service hours check (6:00-23:00)

Negatives:
- No menu system (expects inputs upfront)
- Limited error handling
- No input validation for station/line existence
- Code organization could be better
- Limited comments
Deduction: -5 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (7/10)
✓ Has README File.txt

ISSUES:
- README content not fully reviewed
- Lacks detailed execution instructions
- No explanation of input format
Deduction: -3 marks

6. BONUS FEATURES (0/15)
✗ No additional metro lines
✗ No fare calculation
✗ No extra features

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Clean code structure in visible portions
2. Correct peak hour logic
3. Proper time conversion functions
4. Service hours validation
5. Basic journey planning logic exists

ISSUES:
1. No menu system - expects all inputs upfront
2. Schedule logic not properly implemented as standalone feature
3. Input structure causes testing difficulties
4. Limited ability to verify full functionality

CODE REVIEW:

SCHEDULE LOGIC (PARTIAL):
```python
if(peakA<=minutes<=peakAx):
    frequency=4
elif(peakB<=minutes<=peakBx): 
    frequency=4
else:
    frequency=8
```
This is correct but not integrated into proper module structure.

Station validation:
```python
exist = False
for row in list:
    if row[0].strip() == line:
        if row[1].strip() == station:
            exist = True
            break

if not exist:
    print("Station or Line not found")
    quit()
```
Good validation but abrupt exit.

JOURNEY PLANNER:
Code exists for journey planning but couldn't fully test due to:
- Input structure incompatible with testing method
- No clear menu system
- Upfront input requirements

RECOMMENDATION:
Student has grasp of basic concepts (peak hours, time calculations, station validation) but failed to implement proper module structure with menu system. Code is clean in parts but lacks the required architecture. Needs to restructure with:
1. Menu-based interface
2. Separate modules for schedule and journey planning
3. Better input handling
4. More comprehensive testing

The foundation is there but execution is incomplete.
