               DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - ASSIGNMENT EVALUATION
===============================================================================
Student: Ananya Sen Authi
Roll No: 2025590
Email: ananya25590@iiitd.ac.in
Group: 6
Evaluation Date: December 12, 2025
Total Possible: 100 Regular Marks + 20 Bonus Marks
===============================================================================

CODE EXECUTION STATUS: ⚠ PARTIAL SUCCESS
The code compiles and runs, but contains a critical logic error that breaks
the journey planner functionality completely.

===============================================================================
                        CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
===============================================================================

LOCATION: Line 120 in main.py
ISSUE: Logic Error in Journey Planner

Current Code (INCORRECT):
    if starting_line or not ending_line:
        print("Error: Source or Destination station not found.")
        return

Correct Code Should Be:
    if not starting_line or not ending_line:
        print("Error: Source or Destination station not found.")
        return

IMPACT: This bug causes ALL journey planning tests to fail with "Source or 
Destination station not found" error, even when both stations exist in the 
data. The condition evaluates incorrectly, always triggering the error message.

TEST RESULTS:
✗ Test Case 2 (Dwarka → Botanical Garden): FAILED
✗ Test Case 3 (Kirti Nagar → Rajiv Chowk): FAILED
✗ All journey planning functionality: NON-FUNCTIONAL

Note: According to strict evaluation guidelines, "If there is any compilation 
error/code does not run: Zero marks for the entire assignment." However, since
the code technically runs (just has a logic bug), partial marks are awarded
based on what works correctly.

Assessment: Schedule logic is well-implemented with only minor formatting issues

MARKS DEDUCTED:
- Time formatting (missing leading zeros): -1 mark (loose marking applied)


3. JOURNEY PLANNER (25 marks)
-----------------------------
*** POST-EVALUATION CORRECTION APPLIED ***

Original Submission Status:
✗ CRITICAL BUG: Logic error on line 120 prevented ANY journey from being planned
✗ Bug: "if starting_line or not ending_line:" should be "if not starting_line or not ending_line:"
✗ Test Case 2 (Interchange journey: Dwarka → Botanical Garden): FAILED initially
✗ Test Case 3 (Single line journey: Kirti Nagar → Rajiv Chowk): FAILED initially

After Single-Line Fix:
✓ Line 120 corrected from "if starting_line or" to "if not starting_line or"
✓ Test Case 2 (Dwarka → Botanical Garden): NOW PASSES
  - Output: Correctly calculates interchange journey via Botanical Garden
  - Shows next metro at 9:0, arrival at 10:14, total 74 minutes ✓
✓ Test Case 3 (Kirti Nagar → Rajiv Chowk): NOW PASSES
  - Output: Correctly calculates same-line journey
  - Shows next metro at 9:2, arrival at 9:16, total 14 minutes ✓
✓ Invalid station handling works correctly (error message shown)

Design Analysis (Confirmed Working After Fix):
✓ Correct approach to identify starting and ending lines
✓ Interchange delay properly defined (3 minutes)
✓ Time calculations between stations working correctly
✓ Proper handling for same-line vs interchange journeys
✓ Next metro calculation integrated correctly
✓ Final arrival time calculation logic is sound
✓ Total travel time displayed correctly

The Algorithm Design is Sound and Implementation is Correct:
After the one-line fix, ALL journey planner functionality works perfectly.
This confirms the algorithm was well-designed and the bug was truly just
a simple logic typo (missing "not" operator).

Verified Working:
- Interchange journeys calculate correctly with 3-min delay
- Same-line journeys work without interchange
- Next metro timing integrated properly
- Travel times are accurate
- Error handling for invalid stations works
- Output format is clear and informative

SCORE: 10/25 (Limited partial credit awarded after correction)
Assessment: Works after fix, but heavy deduction for lack of testing

MARKS DEDUCTED:
- Submitted non-functional code without testing: -15 marks
  (Code works perfectly after fixing the typo, BUT student clearly did not
   run/test the code even ONCE before submission)
  
CRITICAL ISSUE: The fact that this trivial fix makes everything work proves
the student NEVER executed their code before submission. Even a single test
run would have immediately revealed the error. This demonstrates:
- No testing or quality assurance
- No verification of functionality
- Poor software development practices
- Submitted untested code

While the algorithm design is good, submitting completely non-functional code
due to lack of basic testing is a serious issue that warrants heavy deduction.


4. CODE QUALITY (15 marks)
--------------------------
Strengths:
✓ Good modular structure with separate functions
  - metro_data(): Data loading
  - get_time_from_start(): Station timing calculation
  - get_time_between(): Travel time calculation
  - calculate_next_metro_time(): Train timing
  - plan_journey(): Route planning
✓ Functions have clear, descriptive names
✓ Reasonable error handling with try-except in metro_data()
✓ Constants used appropriately
  - INTERCHANGE_DELAY = 3
  - DATA_FILE = "metro_data.txt"
✓ Code is generally readable
✓ Decent variable naming (time_sum, current_time_min, etc.)
✓ Proper use of dictionaries for data structures

Weaknesses:
✗ Critical logic typo that should have been caught through testing (-2 marks with loose marking)
  - Line 120: missing "not" operator is essentially a typo
  - Basic test would have revealed the issue immediately
  - However, the algorithm design is fundamentally sound
✗ Bare except clause in metro_data() (line 41) - acceptable for this assignment level (no deduction)
  - Should catch specific exceptions in production code
  - But protects against file read errors appropriately
✗ Limited error messages - acceptable at this level (no deduction)
  - "Error: Could not load metro data" is basic but functional
✗ No comments explaining complex logic sections - acceptable for clean code (no deduction)
  - Functions are reasonably self-explanatory with good naming
✗ Code style issue: spacing in line 58 - minor (no deduction)
  - "stations_map .get" (space before dot)

SCORE: 13/15
Assessment: Good code quality with sound algorithm design, one critical typo

MARKS DEDUCTED:
- Critical logic typo on line 120: -2 marks (loose marking - it's essentially a typo, not a design flaw)


5. DOCUMENTATION (10 marks)
---------------------------
✓ README.md file provided
✓ Clear project description
  - "Metro Route and Schedule Simulator"
  - Explains Blue Line and Magenta Line implementation
✓ Instructions to run the program included
  - File setup requirements
  - Launch commands
  - Expected output description
✓ Data sources documented
  - Official DMRC website cited
  - Data collection methodology explained
✓ Logic and assumptions clearly explained:
  - Service hours: 06:00 AM to 11:00 PM
  - Peak hours: 8-10 AM and 5-7 PM (4 min frequency)
  - Off-peak: 8 min frequency
  - Interchange delay: 3 minutes
✓ File structure requirements specified
  - metro_simulator.py (though actual file is main.py)
  - metro_data.txt

Issues:
✗ File referenced as "metro_simulator.py" in README but actual file is "main.py" (acceptable - no deduction with loose marking)
  - Minor inconsistency, but user can easily figure it out
  - Main.py is clear enough as the entry point
- Could include troubleshooting section (not required)
- No mention of expected output format examples (acceptable)
- No known issues/limitations section (not required at this level)

SCORE: 10/10
Assessment: Comprehensive and clear documentation

MARKS DEDUCTED:
- None (loose marking applied - filename mismatch is minor)


6. ENHANCEMENTS/BONUS (20 marks)
--------------------------------
✗ No fare calculation implemented
✗ Only 2 lines implemented (Blue and Magenta) - exactly as required
✗ No additional lines beyond the base requirement
✗ No advanced features added
✗ No extensions attempted

Observations:
- Focus was on completing the base requirements
- No attempt at bonus features
- Given the critical bug in base functionality, attempting bonus features
  would not have been advisable anyway

*** REVISED AFTER POST-EVALUATION CORRECTION ***

This submission demonstrates good understanding of the problem and solid
algorithm design. However, it suffers from a CRITICAL FLAW: the student
submitted completely non-functional code without testing it even once.

Original Issue (Now Fixed):
- Critical logic bug on line 120 (if starting_line or not ending_line:)
- Fixed to: if not starting_line or not ending_line:
- After fix: Journey planner works flawlessly

Post-Correction Verification Results:
✓ Interchange journeys: Working correctly with proper time calculations
✓ Same-line journeys: Working correctly
✓ Invalid station handling: Working correctly
✓ Next metro integration: Working correctly
✓ Travel time calculations: Accurate
✓ Output formatting: Clear and informative

Strengths Confirmed:
+ Excellent data collection (20/20)
+ Very good schedule logic (29/30)
+ Sound algorithm design - proven by working code after trivial fix
+ Good code structure and modularity
+ Clean, readable code with good function decomposition
+ Excellent documentation (10/10)
+ Proper error handling architecture
+ Well-integrated components

CRITICAL WEAKNESSES:
✗ CODE WAS NEVER TESTED BEFORE SUBMISSION - This is unacceptable
✗ The trivial nature of the fix proves the student never ran the code
✗ Even ONE test execution would have revealed the error immediately
✗ Shows lack of basic software development discipline
✗ Submitted code that gives error messages for ALL valid inputs
✗ No quality assurance or verification performed

What Needs Improvement:
- TESTING IS MANDATORY! Never submit code without running it
- Develop basic QA habits - test at least once before submission
- Code review practices to catch simple logic errors
- Time formatting with leading zeros (minor issue)
- Professional development practices

Learning Points:
1. ALWAYS test your code with real inputs before submission
2. Run at least ONE complete test of each major feature
3. Submitting untested code is a serious professional mistake
4. Double-check boolean conditions in if statements
5. Simple typos can have major impacts - testing catches them

FINAL ASSESSMENT WITH CORRECTION:
The code earned 82/100 after limited partial credit for journey planner (10/25).
The -15 mark deduction reflects that submitting completely untested, non-functional
code is a serious issue, even if the underlying algorithm design is good. While
the student shows promise in algorithm design, the lack of testing demonstrates
poor development practices that must be addressed.

RECOMMENDATION: The student has good foundational skills and solid algorithm
design capabilities. However, the complete lack of testing before submission
is a critical flaw. The student MUST develop basic testing habits. With proper
testing, this would have been a 97/100 submission. Focus on:
1. Testing code at least once before submission
2. Verifying that core features actually work
3. Developing professional QA practices
RECOMMENDATION: The student has good foundational skills but needs to develop
stronger testing and validation habits. The algorithm design shows promise.
