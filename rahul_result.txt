DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Rahul Saini (2025408)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 20/20
- Schedule Logic: 0/30
- Journey Planner: 24/25
- Code Quality: 10/15
- Documentation: 9/10
- Bonus: 12/15
TOTAL: 75/115

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (20/20)
✓ EXCELLENT - COMPLETE DATA
✓ Red Line (full line from Rithala to Shaheed Sthal - 28 stations)
✓ Blue Line (complete with all stations)
✓ Blue1 (Vaishali branch)
✓ Green Line
✓ Magenta Line
✓ Yellow Line
✓ 145 lines of comprehensive data
✓ Travel times included (1-5 minutes, realistic)
✓ Interchange points properly marked
PERFECT SCORE

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (0/30)
✗ NOT IMPLEMENTED AS SEPARATE MODULE
The program calculates metro arrival times but only within journey planning context.
There's no standalone "check next metro at station X" feature.

The code does show metro arrival times:
- "METRO ARRIVING AT BLUE LINE=8:25"
- Uses predictor() function internally

But this is embedded in journey planner, not a separate user-accessible feature.
Required standalone schedule timing query is MISSING.

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (24/25)
✓ WORKS EXCELLENTLY!

Test 1 - Same Line: Dwarka → Botanical Garden at 08:22
Output:
- STATUS: Metro Available
- METRO ARRIVING AT BLUE LINE=8:25
- no interchange needed
- DURATION: 111 minutes
- Arrival Time: 10:13
- FARE: Rs.91
✓ Works correctly

Test 2 - Interchange: Dwarka Sector 21 → Hauz Khas at 08:22
Output:
- one interchange needed at Rajiv Chowk
- METRO ARRIVING AT Rajiv Chowk=11:30
- NEXT METRO ARRIVING AT Rajiv Chowk = 11:34
- DURATION: 130 minutes
- Arrival Time: 10:32
- FARE: Rs.91
✓ Handles interchange correctly

EXCELLENT FEATURES:
+ Comprehensive case-based routing
+ Handles 1, 2, and 3 interchange scenarios
+ Shows all interchange stations
+ Calculates accurate travel times
+ Includes fare calculation

Minor issue:
- Shows spurious "station not found" error message but continues correctly
Deduction: -1 mark

4. CODE QUALITY (10/15)
Positives:
+ EXTENSIVE CODE: 1214 lines showing thorough implementation
+ Multiple helper functions (time_checker, duration, predictor, jrny_pred)
+ Handles many edge cases
+ Fare calculation included

Negatives:
- No menu system (all inputs upfront)
- Very long code with much repetition
- Many hardcoded case statements (could use more elegant routing algorithm)
- Error handling issues (shows "station not found" incorrectly)
- Limited comments for such long code
Deduction: -5 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (9/10)
✓ EXCELLENT README files
✓ Readme_main.txt: Clear explanation of approach and functions
✓ Readme_bonus.txt: Describes additional features
✓ Explains assumptions (first metro starts at 6:00 from both ends)
✓ Lists all functions with descriptions
✓ Good detail on special cases

Minor issue:
- Could use better formatting
Deduction: -1 mark

6. BONUS FEATURES (12/15)
✓ RED LINE: Complete implementation (5 marks)
✓ YELLOW LINE: Complete implementation (5 marks)
✓ FARE CALCULATION: Based on duration (2 marks)
✓ ERROR HANDLING: station_checker() function
✓ METRO STATUS: Checks service availability
✓ WAITING TIME: 1 minute per station

Deduction: -3 marks for fare calculation being simple (duration-based, not distance-based as per DMRC)

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Comprehensive data collection with 4 bonus lines
2. Extensive journey planning with complex multi-interchange routing
3. Good documentation explaining approach
4. Fare calculation and error handling included
5. Shows dedication with 1214 lines of code

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. No separate schedule timing module (missing Phase 2 Part A)
2. No menu interface - expects all inputs upfront
3. Code is very long with much repetition
4. Could use more elegant algorithm instead of case-by-case handling

CODE REVIEW:
The jrny_pred() function is massive with special case handling for every possible route combination. While thorough, this approach:
- Is difficult to maintain
- Has much duplicated code
- Could be replaced with a proper graph algorithm like Dijkstra's

However, it shows the student understands the problem thoroughly and handles edge cases.

RECOMMENDATION:
Student shows strong commitment and thoroughness with extensive implementation. Journey planner works well for multiple lines and complex interchanges. However, needs to implement separate schedule timing module and use more efficient algorithms. Good bonus features implementation.
