DELHI METRO SIMULATOR - EVALUATION REPORT
Student: Yash Yadav (2025573)
Date: December 13, 2025
========================================

FINAL SCORES:
- Data Collection: 18/20
- Schedule Logic: 0/30
- Journey Planner: 20/25
- Code Quality: 12/15
- Documentation: 8/10
- Bonus: 7/15
TOTAL: 65/115

========================================

1. DATA COLLECTION (18/20)
✓ COMPREHENSIVE DATA
✓ Blue Line complete
✓ Magenta Line complete
✓ Data format: Line, Station, Next Station, Time, Interchange
✓ 6-line blocks for each entry (includes blank line separator)
✓ Good data organization
✓ Interchange points marked
✓ Realistic travel times (1-5 minutes)

PROFESSIONAL APPROACH:
+ Clean data structure
+ Proper interchange marking
+ Good coverage of both lines

ISSUES:
- Some minor formatting inconsistencies
Deduction: -2 marks

2. SCHEDULE LOGIC (0/30)
✗ NOT IMPLEMENTED

The program does NOT have a separate schedule timing module.
Cannot query "when is next metro at station X" independently.

All timing calculations are embedded within journey planner only.

The code goes directly to journey planning with these inputs:
- Current station
- Final station
- Time at the moment

Required standalone schedule timing query is COMPLETELY MISSING.

3. JOURNEY PLANNER (20/25)
✓ WORKS WELL!

NO MENU - Expects inputs upfront:
```python
begin = input("Enter the current station: ")
end = input("Enter the final station: ")
t0 = input("Time at the moment: ")
```

Test: Dwarka → Botanical Garden at 08:22
Output:
```
|Same Line Journey|
Route: Dwarka-->Dwarka Mor-->Nawada-->...-->Botanical Garden
Total Time: 64.5 minutes
Final Arrival Time: 9:26
Fare for the trip in inr is: 70
```

EXCELLENT FEATURES:
✓ Shows complete route with all stations listed
✓ Calculates total travel time accurately
✓ Shows final arrival time
✓ INCLUDES FARE CALCULATION
✓ Distinguishes between same-line and interchange journeys
✓ Good route visualization

CODE QUALITY:
+ ver_stn() function handles case-insensitive station names
+ Good error handling with ValueError checks
+ Time validation (24-hour format check)
+ Interchange detection logic
+ Helper functions: to_min(), to_strtime()

ISSUES:
- No menu system (all inputs upfront)
- Couldn't test interchange fully
- No subsequent metro times shown
Deduction: -5 marks

4. CODE QUALITY (12/15)
Positives:
+ EXCELLENT ERROR HANDLING:
  ```python
  if ":" not in t0 or not t0.replace(":", "").isdigit():
      raise ValueError("Please enter the time in HH:MM format.")
  ```
+ Case-insensitive station matching
+ Time format validation
+ Good helper functions (to_min, to_strtime, ver_stn)
+ Clean variable names
+ Good comments explaining logic
+ 430 lines of well-organized code

Negatives:
- No menu system
- All inputs expected upfront
- Could be more modular
Deduction: -3 marks

5. DOCUMENTATION (8/10)
✓ EXCELLENT: TWO README files!
✓ README.md (main assignment)
✓ README_BONUS.md (bonus features)

Good documentation with clear separation of main and bonus features.

ISSUES:
- Could explain the no-menu approach
- More execution examples would help
Deduction: -2 marks

6. BONUS FEATURES (7/15)
✓ FARE CALCULATOR: Well implemented (7 marks)
  - Shows fare in rupees
  - Based on number of stations traveled
  - DMRC-style pricing
  - Integrated cleanly into journey output

Example: "Fare for the trip in inr is: 70"

✗ No additional metro lines

Good fare implementation but limited to this one bonus feature.

========================================
DETAILED ANALYSIS:

STRENGTHS:
1. Journey planner works well with detailed output
2. EXCELLENT error handling and input validation
3. Case-insensitive station matching (user-friendly!)
4. Time format validation
5. Fare calculator integrated smoothly
6. Shows complete route with all stations
7. Two README files (main + bonus)
8. Clean, readable code

UNIQUE FEATURES:
- Case-insensitive station name handling (very user-friendly!)
- Comprehensive input validation
- 24-hour format check
- Detailed route display with --> arrows

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. NO SCHEDULE TIMING MODULE (missing entire Phase 2 Part A)
2. No menu system - expects all inputs upfront
3. Cannot query metro timings independently

CODE REVIEW:

ERROR HANDLING (EXCELLENT):
```python
# Station validation
begin = ver_stn(begin)
end = ver_stn(end)
if begin is None or end is None:
    raise ValueError("Incorrect Station name entered.")

# Time format validation
if ":" not in t0 or not t0.replace(":", "").isdigit():
    raise ValueError("Please enter the time in HH:MM format.")

# Time range validation
h, m = map(int, t0.split(":"))
if h < 0 or h > 23 or m < 0 or m > 59:
    raise ValueError("The time should be entered in 24hr format.")
```

This is EXCELLENT error handling! Shows maturity in coding practices.

CASE-INSENSITIVE MATCHING:
```python
def ver_stn(name):
    for x in stns:
        if x.lower() == name.lower():
            return x
    return None
```
Very user-friendly! Users can type "rajiv chowk" or "Rajiv Chowk" - both work.

JOURNEY OUTPUT:
```
|Same Line Journey|
Route: Dwarka-->Dwarka Mor-->Nawada-->...
Total Time: 64.5 minutes
Final Arrival Time: 9:26
Fare for the trip in inr is: 70
```
Clean, informative output with all key information.

TIME HELPERS:
```python
def to_min(t):
    h, m = map(int, t.split(":"))
    return 60*h + m

def to_strtime(total):
    total = int(total)
    h = total // 60
    m = total % 60
    return f"{h}:{m:02d}"
```
Clean utility functions.

ROUTE BUILDING:
The code builds routes intelligently:
- t_same for same-line route time
- t_inter for interchange route time
- Compares both to find optimal route
- Shows detailed station progression

RECOMMENDATION:
This is a GOOD SUBMISSION with excellent error handling and user-friendly features. The case-insensitive station matching and comprehensive input validation show professional coding practices.

However, CRITICAL OMISSIONS:
1. No schedule timing module (Phase 2 Part A completely missing)
2. No menu system

With these additions, this would be a top-tier submission. The error handling and validation are among the best in the class.

Student clearly understands:
- Input validation
- Error handling
- User experience
- Route finding algorithms
- Time calculations

Just needs to implement the missing schedule module and add a menu interface.
