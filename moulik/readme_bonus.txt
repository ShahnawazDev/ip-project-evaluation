For extra features a fare calculator has been added under the following assumptions:

Fare for going in one station = Rs 10
Fare for interchange = 30

This means that going from one station to another without changing the line will cost Rs 20
Going from one station of one line to another station of another line will cost 10+30+10 = Rs 50
Going from one station of one line to a station of another line with 2 interchanges will cost 10 + 30 + 30 + 10 = Rs 80
